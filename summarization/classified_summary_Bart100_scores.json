People eat during races in order to have their glycogen replenished.  But it would defnitely be unhealthy to stay in such a glycogen-depleted state, and you'd have a massive buildup of the stress hormone cortisol -- which, oddly enough, causes the body to store fat.

      "That's the theory, but it depends on your calorie intake as well. You could also build muscle. Don't forget water weight either. The scale is deceiving.",
      "Theoretically you have to have a deficit of 3500 calories to lose a pond - that is 3500 calories less than you body needs depending on your metabolism, etc.  If you eat enough calories to make up for the exercise, then you wouldn't lose the weight.  And doing 3500 calories worth of exercise in one day is a LOT of exercise!!  The most I have ever done in one day is probably about 1500 calories worth of exercise, and I found that was really pushing it for me.\n\nI do understand your frustration.  It seems to take so long to lose the weight.  Try decreasing your caloric intake a little and also drinking more water, lots of water.  Making these two slight changes in addition to the exercise may speed up the process.\n\nFor me eating an orange or two everyday seemed to speed the process along - they are high in water and fibre with relatively low calories and they suppress hunger and are high in nutrients.\n\nThe two links I've included may be helpful to you.  They help keep me on track.  Good luck with it.",
      "If you could keep up that level of exercise, I guess so. But I think that probably you'd start losing muscle and really harming your body.\nDon't forget that building muscles increases your base metabolism.  The more muscle you have, the faster you'll get thinner. Notice I didn't say \"lose weight\" because muscle is more dense than fat.  (Eventually you will lose weight as well.)"

Are you asking whether the HPV will go away (no), or whether your pap smear abnormality will go away (possibly)? Many women have what you have and they are fine.

    "bestanswer": "HPV is an STD. Studies conducting from examining the medical records of patients treated for STD's suggests that promiscuous behavior starts as early as nine but tappers off by the time one gets twenty-six, at least on average. Although you can get cervical cancer and not have HPV, the likelihood is infinitesimally small. However you can't get HPV without having unprotected sex, which is a promiscuous behavior. So after 26 typically, you are (hopefully) beyond the promiscuous behavior stage and should not need the vaccine.",

    "bestanswer": "Depends on the drug use (frequency and dosages) and the test.  On cheap and inefficient tests, you may be perceived as clear within days, but we have some tests that are looking for any trace residual amounts and it may take months or years for some common drugs to be cleaned out.  Some of the new non-tobacco user drug tests that life insurance companies use will raise flags if a person has used tobacco in the past 2-5 years!  With the motivation that some companies face (government contracts for instance), some are using some pretty sophisticated tests for common drugs and they may be just about as sensitive.  I worked for one company where there were three long-time users and they had little to fear because our \"screenings\" were cheap and not random.  They got by undetected for years (one got sloppy and showed up to work while still high and the other almost terminally OD'ed at home one weekend and it hit the newspapers)--semiannual tests didn't catch them because they were clean by the time the scheduled samples were taken.\n\nSome of the chemicals people use, however, are of types and sophistication that you practically have to be intentionally looking for them, but most opiates have chemical signatures that if a person is using at all, some tests, though definitely not all, will catch you even months later.",

BTW, you can take up to 800mg of ibuprofin at one time, just take it with food and stretch to 4-6 hours. the ice bag and tylenol won't help - trust me i had even higher powered stuff.... it tastes nasty (drink some ginger ale after - it plays off the flavor). the dentist will do the same thing. good luck and feel bvetter!!!!

If its being stimulated I can maintain one to ejaculate and as soon as I ejaculate I go totally soft (even when I was a kid this was the case).\n\nI'm wondering if this would be considered ED?  I'm 34, relatively  healthy, a little overweight and I smoke on the weekends.   I take two medicines-propecia and lexapro.   I know the lexapro can reduce your libido which has happened with me but like I said, 90% of the time I can't maintain an erection without the stimulation.\n\nI did some research online about homeopathic remidies and started taking Korean Ginseng 2700mg a day and also got Yohimbe in liquid form.  Has anyone tried either of these?\n\nThanks for your help",
    "bestanswer": "Yes, it is a form of ED. Some men can't get an erection at all and some men can't maintain one. A friend of mine told me once that her husband used a ring at the base of his penis that helped him maintain his erections. I don't know the nice term for it, but the rude one is a *ock ring",

      "You're a little young to be having this problem. The weight and smoking frankly probably don't help. I've never seen any evidence that either of those herbs help although just staying healthy and eating right can. I would see a doctor.

Let a doc check you out though because erectile dysfunction can be a symtom of several diseases, heart problems and diabetes in particular. He will probably say okay and give you a prescription and a sample six pack. When we first begin to have intercourse, some us have problems maintaining erections because it's just a different feeling than masturbation and less pressure may be involved. Those problems should go away in a short time though. See your doctor dude!",
      "Yes I would believe that this is a form of ED.\n I went to my Doc the other day and told him that I could get an erection but it just was not as hard as it used to be. He gave me a sample pack of Lavitra. I worked wonderful.  \nWith the medication that you are taking now, I would consult you Doctor before taking any kind of ED meds. \nI experienced a stuffy nose, a headache, a slight case of dizziness, and a tremendous woody.\n\nGood Luck",

    "bestanswer": "No, wet shoes cannot cause a sore throat.  Only bacteria or a virus could cause this.  However, what your child endured was abuse.  Not allowing a child to use the bathroom when necessary is abusive, and a disgrace!  Make sure the principal DOES something about this incident, and don't take no for an answer!

Pls help me interpret these tests!!!  \n\n-M-MONO for the 4 & 1/2 Yrs has come up positive. 12.2-12.6 (tested 3X's)\n-ANTI rnp has tested positive 2X's in 3 yrs.  Level @ 2.04, 2nd level can't \n figure out.\n-ANA ab: Postive 2X's.  I can't figure what the levels R on this one.\n\nI have been having the following medical issues: \n\nMigraines, menorrhagia, SEVERE, constant fatigue, tachycardia, periods of bracycardia, weight gain, rare spells of complete weakness (My BP goes sky high, my HR goes high, and I shake badly.) I am thirsty all of the time-I probably drink over 2 gallons of water a day!, feel like I need to swallow all the time.\n\nI've taken matters into my hands 'cause I can't live like an invalid any longer!

    "content": "i just started my period im 14 and i dont really\nlike talking to my mom about this...\nhow do u insert a tampon???",
    "bestanswer": "These instructions should make first time tampon insertion easier:\n\n\nFirst, look at the tampon. The larger outer tube that holds the tampon itself at the very end is the top \u2013 this is the part that is inserted into the vagina. Think \u2013 top = tampon. The thinner inside tube is the one where the string is showing. This is the inner or bottom tube \u2013 the part that is used to push the tampon in. \nWash your hands. Stand or sit in a comfortable position. Sit on the toilet with your legs apart and lean slightly forward, or try standing with your knees slightly bent. Standing with one foot up on the tub also works for some girls. Most of the time, you'll end up putting in a tampon while you're on the toilet \u2013 so that's a good place to start. \n\nLook at the tampon applicator again \u2013 you'll see some ridges, this is the finger grip, on the larger tube. With the thumb and middle finger of one hand, hold the applicator lightly on the outer insertion tube at the grip location, with the larger outer tube facing up toward your body and the thinner inner tube pointing down toward the floor. \n\nWith your other hand, gently separate the folds of skin around the vaginal opening. Put the tip of the larger outer tube of the tampon applicator in the opening of the vagina. Are you still breathing?! Don't forget to! It helps you stay relaxed.\n\nThe vagina slants upward and toward the back. So, aim the tampon toward a point low on the small of your back (the curved area of your lower back). Now, take a deep breath, let it out, and relax. Then gently push the larger, outer tube of the applicator into the vagina. Stop when your thumb and middle finger are touching the vaginal opening. \nNOTE: For flushable (cardboard) applicator tampons, ease in the applicator by slightly twisting or rotating it from side to side. Don't twist a plastic applicator, this slides in best when pushed straight in at the proper angle.\n\n\nNext, put your index finger (or a finger on the other hand) at the end of the inner, thinner tube (where the cord comes out). Push this inner tube slowly until it's completely inside the larger tube. This pushes the tampon out of the applicator and into your vagina. Move your finger from the end so that the string hangs free. Keep your thumb and middle finger on the outer tube grip.\n\nNow, holding the tubes (that are now inside each other) firmly but gently remove them from the vagina. (The cardboard tubes can be flushed away.) (IF USING TAMPAX PEARL PLASTIC OR TAMPAX COMPAK, DO NOT FLUSH THE PLASTIC APPLICATOR OR WRAPPER.) Place the used plastic applicator back into the discreet wrapper or wrap it in toilet paper and throw it in the trash.) If the tampon is in correctly, you shouldn't feel it at all. If it feels uncomfortable, it's probably not placed far enough into your vagina. The uncomfortable feeling comes from the tampon rubbing against the muscle at the opening of the vagina. If this happens, remove the tampon and use a fresh one, trying to insert it a little deeper into the vagina.\n\nTo remove a tampon, relax your muscles. Slowly and gently pull the removal string downward at the same angle you used to insert the tampon. Don\u2019t worry about the string \u2013 it\u2019s securely sewn throughout the tampon. If you feel discomfort while removing the tampon, it probably means you didn\u2019t need to change it because it hadn\u2019t absorbed enough yet. You may either want to wear a tampon longer next time or use a lower absorbency.",

I went to the gynecologist and she perscribed me the Yasmin birth contol pill.  I absoultley LOVE it!  One symptom I had before birth contol was a lot of pain when I was highly active, for example jogging or running now I have no pain.  I also had pretty bad acne and the pill has helped so much with that too. I highly reccomend it for you.  Women with PCOS do usually have problems getting pregnant but I have heard that there is a drug called Clomid that can help with that, I don't know much about it...but I would like to know more.

    "bestanswer": "Hi there. Try this.\n\nThe naturopathic approach to Candida infection is to improve resistance to infection, whilst at the same time addressing the overgrowth of the Candida organism.\n\n\nProbiotics such as acidophilus and bifidus bacteria are \"good\" bacteria that normally inhabit the digestive tract and the vagina. Probiotic supplementation may help to address the imbalance caused by an overgrowth of Candida, and may help relieve digestive symptoms such as flatulence and diarrhoea.\n\nThe mineral chromium assists the body with sugar utilisation and may help to reduce sugar craving symptoms; (if you are diabetic, discuss this with your healthcare professional before using it)\n\nThe herb garlic has anti-fungal properties and is prescribed to assist with fungal infections such as Candida\n\nEchinacea stimulates the body's resistance and may help to reduce susceptibility to infection\n\nImportant Notes\nMany antibacterial, corticosteroid and immuno-suppressive therapies increase susceptibility to Candida, as do pregnancy, diabetes and some other diseases. Consult with your healthcare professional if you have concerns in this regard.\n\n\nIn certain individuals, such as those with depleted immunity, Candida infection may require immediate medical attention.\n\n\n\nRecurrent thrush is sometimes due to an infected sexual partner - both people may need to be treated before the situation is resolved. \n\n\n\nRecurrent thrush in babies may indicate that the mother's nipples are infected. Your healthcare professional will prescribe a suitable topical preparation.\n\nPrevention\nCandida is more likely to develop in warm, moist environments. Try to wear cotton rather than nylon underwear, and always ensure a baby's nappy is changed as quickly as possible.\n\n\n\nA healthy diet and lifestyle combined with good hygiene will reduce the likelihood of developing Candida. Avoid excessive amounts of yeast-based foods such as bread and try not to eat too many sugary foods.\n Hope this helps.\n\nCraig - Naturopath",

The results of liposuction depend on your skin elasticity so give it time. liposuction can get rid of your flab.. but it cant exactly help you lose weight for good. since your not dieting the extra weight off and learning how to eat healthy.. then most likely after you get your lipsuction .. you'll gain it all back because you'll think yu can whatever you want.. and you basicly end up wasting most of you money.. it happens to most people who get it.. your better off dieting. it wont do anything for excess skin, just fat.. its worth it... if its done my an experience pl. surgeon than its totally safe IT ONLY SUCKS OUT FAT BUT U DONT NEED LIPOSUCTION ALL IT DOES IT GIVES U LOTS OF PAIN AND BRUSIES SORES.. MY TEACHER SHE LOST WEIGHT ALOT OF WIGHT BY EXERCISING AND SHE WENT ON A DIET GO TO BALLI FITTNESS CENTER OR ANY GYM FOR BOUT 4 DAYS A WEEK AND FOR BOUT 3 HOURS DRINK WATER EAT VEGETABLES AND SALADS GGET A PERSONAL TRAINER U MITE THINK ITS EASY FOR ME TO SAY BUT THATS NOT HARD LIPOSUTION MESES U UP LATER ON IN LIFE NO MATTER HOW OLD U ARE TRUST ME!!

    "subject": "Do I have skin cancer?",
    "content": "I went to the doctor a week ago to have two odd moles looked at. She decided to do an incisional biopsy on them. Yesterday the doc called and said that one of them was a \"highly atypical nevus\" and that I should come back ASAP to get more tissue removed with a margin. I'm going in tomorrow to do that. When I asked what that means, she said that we'd talk about it in person. Now I'm worried.\n\nI'm only 26, but I have a lot of risk factors for skin cancer--family history, blue eyes and red hair, pale skin and freckles, many many bad sunburns, congenital nevi (moles I was born with), and a precancerous mole that was removed 7 years ago. That's why I keep a close eye on my skin and went to the doc in the first place. \n\nDoes this mean that I have (or probably have) skin cancer?",
    "bestanswer": "First, \"naevus\" or \"nevus\" just means a pigmented lesion on your skin, like a birth mark. Most are benign. However, when she called, she obviously had gotten some suspicious pathology reports back, and wants to take a closer look. Getting a sample with a border allows her to compare your normal cells with those of the area she's testing. When she takes the sample, they preserve it (usually in alcohol), then embed it in a parafin block, and take very very thin slices of it with a microtome blade. These slices are mounted on microscope slides, and a pathologist reviews them for signs of malignancy. \n  There are some things you can look at on your own body, though. They're called the ABC's of skin cancer, and diagnosticians and general practitioners learn them in med school. A = asymmetry (the mole is not a circle or oval, but blebbs, and has an inconsistent shape) B = Border (if the border is not smooth, it may signal a problem) and C = colour (color changes in nevi are not good. normal colors are shades of brown, turning red or black can signal a problem). These rules are not hard and fast, but serve as a good tool. \n\nGood luck.",

Getting a sample with a border allows her to compare your normal cells with those of the area she's testing. When she takes the sample, they preserve it (usually in alcohol), then embed it in a parafin block, and take very very thin slices of it with a microtome blade. These slices are mounted on microscope slides, and a pathologist reviews them for signs of malignancy.   There are some things you can look at on your own body, though. They're called the ABC's of skin cancer, and diagnosticians and general practitioners learn them in med school.
