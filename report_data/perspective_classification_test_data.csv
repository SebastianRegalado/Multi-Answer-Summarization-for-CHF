how can i get gastric bypass or lap band if i have no insurance or alot of money?,,"Ask your doctor first if you could have the surgery assuming that you have the funds.  Next, not having the funds, call the doctor's office that does the work and ask if they have a payment plan.  If not, then ask if they know of one.  Dentists many times subscribe to these loan agencies so their patients can have cosmetic dentistry; so you could call a bunch of them.  If this fails, then, assuming that you are morbidly obese, and this is such a problem for you that you are in essence of fact disabled, then apply for Medicaid and/or Medicare (this could take up to one year) and get special dispensation.  This latter will likely work if you have the patience and diligence.  But if you are committed, then keep trying by calling.  When you call and get a negative answer, ask if they could give you some advice or steer you to someone who may know the answer; keep track of the numbers and people so you do not duplicate your work.

Your primary doctor can often point you in the right direction. If you live in a city with a medical school, you can call the appropriate department (OB-GYN or Urology) and they can refer you to thier group for evaluation. 

A lot of large multi-specialty groups, such as Mayo Clinic etc, have internationally recognized expertise in infertility.

This starts the cascade.
Blood clots (emboli) are partsof clots thathave broken off and travel through the blood vessels (either venous or arterial) and stop where their size becomes and issue with the tube they are in.  Venous clots are generally safer than arterial, however, both have their consequences.  in your ?, the clots break off and travel to the pulmnonary vasculature...depending on how small, you may experience a twinge (or nothing at all) to sudden dealth by the 'saddle embolis' that now occludes both pulmonary arteries.

HELP!
thx","Well, I'm not a woman, but I'd say ""no"", that's not normal.
It sounds like you're not making enough natural lubrication.  Perhaps you and your partner are getting 'to it' a bit too fast, and you're not giving your body enough time to get worked up and produce some lubrication... 
Next time, take it slow, play around, and get nice and excited first.
Also, some women simply have that problem and can't produce enough lubrication themselves. Go get a bottle of KY Jelly or something simliar (your local drugstore should carry it) and have him put it on.  Do NOT use petrolium jelly (vasoline) with a latex condom!)
The burning you feel is probably either the lack of wetness OR, I suspect that if you're getting minor tearing at the beginning before you get wet enough, then it's the coating/spermicide on the condom. Imagine salt on a cut, that's the picture.

She has to do it lovingly as part of the lovemaking. That way, you can't get soft.

On the other hand, you need to think a little bit why you go soft during the process of wearing a condom and solve the root cause. It might have to do with an innate dislike for the condoms, in which case you need to start to find a way to like it, like trying several types till you find one you like. If you generally go soft whenever you have a few seconds of diversion from sexual activity, that is a different case and you need to seek help.

Why and how does losing weight help my diabetes?,,"Diabetes (to oversimplify this complex disease) is a cascade of chemical problems which no longer allow for control of the blood sugar level.

The vital organ for storing sugar in the short term is the LIVER.  the more you weigh, the more work the liver is doing to transfer sugar in and out of the bloodstream.

Lose weight and the liver has less work to do and can more precisely control blood sugar.

Lose weight and excess fat in the liver itself (""fatty liver"") is reduced; a fatty liver doesn't work as efficiently as a normal liver.

Secondly, a diet designed for weight loss automatically has less sugar and fat in it than your normal diet.  No one ever got diabetes from a high-protein, high-fiber, low-fat, low-sugar diet.

what would cause pregnancy hormone to not be found in urine?,what causes pregnancy hormones to not be found in urine and only through blood?,"sometimes it is just too early to register on a urine pregnancy test.

what is the cure to the skin disease pelagra?,,"Since pellagra is a disorder brought about by niacin deficiency. The treatment would be to supplement the individual's diet with a form of niacin called niacinamide (niacin itself in pure supplementation form causes a number of unpleasant side effects, including sensations of itching, burning, and flushing). The niacinamide can be given orally or by injection (when diarrhea would interfere with its absorption). The usual oral dosage is 300-500 mg each day; the usual dosage of an injection is 100-250 mg, administered two to three times each day. When pellagra has progressed to the point of the encephalopathic syndrome, a patient will require 1,000 mg of niacinamide orally, and 100-250 mg of niacinamide by injection. Once the symptoms of pellagra have subsided, a maintenance dose of niacin can be calculated, along with attempting (where possible) to make appropriate changes in the diet. Because many B-complex vitamin deficiencies occur simultaneously, patients will usually require the administration of other B-complex vitamins as well.
Untreated pellagra is fatal, so be sure to go to a doctor immediately and consult on how you would like to be treated","The treatment would be to supplement the individual's diet with a form of niacin called niacinamide (niacin itself in pure supplementation form causes a number of unpleasant side effects, including sensations of itching, burning, and flushing).",Skin Conditions,Health,Diseases & Conditions,,,,treatment
Is there a natural cure for menstrual cramps?,"What causes menstrual cramps?



How can you cure menstrual cramps with things form nature?","People have been unable to identify a single cause of PMS. Theories range from hormonal and chemical to nutritional and psychological. Women whose mother or sisters have PMS are more likely to have it, so there may be a genetic component. A combination of genetic, physiological, and environmental causes are likely. Making dietary adjustments starting about 14 days before a period may help some women with certain mild menstrual disorders, such as cramping.
Good luck with that.  I used to have them too.  However my mother told me that they get better afyter you have a baby.  I am not sure about that.  I am pregnant.  Please don't take the advices too closely to heart.  i am not saying get pregnant, every woman is different.  Try drinking chamomile tea.

Have there ever been a doucmented case of pancreatic cancer going into remission?,,"Many people have been cured of all sorts of cancer. The doctors call a cure 'going into remission'.

I have always believed that the mainstream medical industry is not interested in finding a cure for cancer because it makes too much profit with its present barbarous methods.
Eventually, I came across a detailed report which agreed with my findings, and I have included it in my web page at

http://dgwa1.fortunecity.com/body/cancer.html

By reading this report, you will also convince yourself that it is best to ignore the mainstream cancer industry, and seek alternative cures. Also you should bear in mind that the medical industry will do anything to protect its profitable position, including disparaging alternative healers or even creating bogus court cases.

I believe that cancer is a whole body thing, which in 80 percent of cases manifests itself by producing symptoms in the weaker parts of the body, and therefore appearing localised. It is this treatment of symptoms instead of cause which creates the profitable, yet non-successful approach of mainstream medicine.

Some cures are listed on the web page too.

It is therefore obvious that a holistic approach is required, based on cleansing, diet, exercise and debugging.","It is this treatment of symptoms instead of cause which creates the profitable, yet non-successful approach of mainstream medicine.",Cancer,Health,Diseases & Conditions,,,,information
