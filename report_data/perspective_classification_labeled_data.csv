Does anyone have trouble breathing when it is humid out?,I have shortness of breath during humid times.  I also experience burning sensation in my chest when exercising sometimes.  What is this?,"Because your lungs work on a system that diffuses oxygen through moisture on the alvioli (little nodes on the inside of your lungs) and the blood stream. This means that the oxygen has to be diffused in liquid form.

When it is really humid the air is already heavy with moisture in the form of water. This is not as easy to transfer to the moisture on the alvioli that are oxygen rich because the oxygen in the air is held in a water compound. 

When it is dry air, the moisture on the alvioli picks up the Oxygen more efficiently and it is easier to breath/",When it is really humid the air is already heavy with moisture in the form of water.,Respiratory Diseases,Health,Diseases & Conditions,cause,,,information

Why and how does losing weight help my diabetes?,,"Diabetes (to oversimplify this complex disease) is a cascade of chemical problems which no longer allow for control of the blood sugar level.

The vital organ for storing sugar in the short term is the LIVER.  the more you weigh, the more work the liver is doing to transfer sugar in and out of the bloodstream.

Lose weight and the liver has less work to do and can more precisely control blood sugar.

Lose weight and excess fat in the liver itself (""fatty liver"") is reduced; a fatty liver doesn't work as efficiently as a normal liver.

Secondly, a diet designed for weight loss automatically has less sugar and fat in it than your normal diet.  No one ever got diabetes from a high-protein, high-fiber, low-fat, low-sugar diet.

Losing weight does not CURE diabetes but it can help minimize the problem.","No one ever got diabetes from a high-protein, high-fiber, low-fat, low-sugar diet.",Diabetes,Health,Diseases & Conditions,,,,information

How may I lower my blood pressure?,"I am 31 years old, five foot ten, and weigh about 280 pounds. I am a male (man). : )

However, I know for a fact that I am obese. I know I need to lose about 30-50 pounds to be healthy for my bone structure and body type/size. I am starting to exercise a little bit, little by little.

I ended up going to the hospital on Tuesday with EXTREMELY extremely high blood pressure readings. At one point, it got as high as apx. 230/190 or so. I was scared, stressed out, and nervous about the trip to the hospital, so it peaked. The nurse had taken it a few minutes earlier, and was alarmed...it was about 190/140 at that time.

Should i be taking this - or am i setting myself up for lots of problems later?,"First of all, you shouldn't be asking for medical advice on here. You never know what you will get.

My own personal advice (check with your doctor). I have known a few people on Prozac and from what they have told me is that it doesn't change your personality or who they perceive themselves to be. What it does do is make it seem ""okay"" everything seems ""okay"". They tell me that it feels like they are walking in some kind of a fog and even looking down on themselves from time to time. However, with the right dosage these effects are kept to a minimum.

As for getting off the medicine, they will wean you off the medicine a little at a time because just stopping is dangerous.

Other things that seem to help. Check your diet for essential oils. I have been told that fish, like Tuna and Salmon, are good for fighting off depressive feelings if eaten on a regular basis. Also, exercise is a good stimulant (you can even get addicted to it), try something low impact at first. If you find that exercise is too mind numbing try martial arts (it exercises both your body and brain).

The bladder is normally sterile, and if you for some reason get fecal matter in the area of your urethra, the e coli bacteria that's helpful in your intestine can wreak havoc on your urinary tract.  If you don't urinate often enough to flush bacteria out of the urethra, it's able to move up it to the bladder, where it starts to cause problems.  

No matter what you do, while you're on your meds and even afterwards, drink plenty of fluids (hence the recommended 8 glasses a day) so that you urinate regularly and often.  That will help to flush some of it out of your system and keep it from coming back.

Hematospermia
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
Jump to: navigation, search
Hematospermia, or the presence of blood in semen, is most often a benign and idiopathic symptom, but can sometimes result from medical problems such as a urethral stricture, infection of the prostate, or a congenital bleeding disorder, and can occur transiently after surgical procedures such as a prostate biopsy. It is present in less than 2% of urology referrals, although prevalence in the overall population is unknown.

Patients with hematospermia should be evaluated by a urologist to identify or rule out medical causes. Idiopathic hematospermia is sometimes treated with tetracycline and prostatic massage.",Hematospermia,Men's Health,Health,Men's Health,,,,cause

chest pain is either sharp or like nerve pain.
Everytime i went to the hospital 3 different times 3 different doctors.
I also have diarheeha","That's diarrhea. Meantime heart pain is usually more of a heaviness or pressure type pain not a sharp pain. I would be inclined to think your obesity is the culprit. All that excess fat presses on internal organs and can cause sluggish digestion and can press upward on the stomach causing pain. Time to find a good weight loss diet. Considering the number of tests you have had I would guess anxiety is also a big factor at this point.

You can also develop psoriasis on the rest of your body. Go to see your GP instead of a homeopathic doctor for diagnosis.

do staph infections cause migranes?,,"Migraines are the monster headaches that are simply vessels in your brain and brain area constricting. A staph infection will not cause this to happen. A staph infection COULD cause a sinus headache if the bacteria get into your sinus cavities. The best avenue would be for you to consult your doctor or medical practitioner. He/she will either prescribe antibiotic medication or a homeopathic script that will heal the infection and will heal the sinus area. If you want to help this for now until you see your doctor, try drinking the following: 1/4 teaspoon thyme in a cup of boiling water. Let the thyme steep for 10 minutes. Add 1 teaspoon of lemon juice and sweeten to taste, if you wish. The thyme tea will kill bacteria and will loosen sinus congestion and phlegm/mucus. You could also drink a hot bowl of soup with 1/2 teaspoon of garlic powder and a dash of cayenne pepper. This will also kill bacteria and loosen mucus.

"ok. I am wondering, if someone has cold sores, and I engage in unprotected vaginal  sex, but not oral sex?","and they don't have a breakout. Will I acquire the cold sore virus?

Also, if they have cold sores, does that mean that they also have genital herpes?","Cold sores and genital herpes are caused by the herpes simplex virus (HSV).  There are two very closely related strains of HSV and typically oral-facial lesions (cold sores) are due to HSV type 1, while genital lesions are caused by HSV type 2.  It is possible to have oral herpes and not genital herpes (or vice versa), since transmission of these viruses are separate events.  Many people are infected but do not have clinical symptoms - approximately 75% of adults have been infected with HSV-1 and 20% with HSV-2.

While HSV-1 and HSV-2 may have adapted somewhat to these particular biological sites, there is no medical reason that someone cannot get a genital type 1 infection or a oral type 2 infection.  In fact, approximately 20% of genital herpes lesions are due to the type 1 virus.

A final word of warning: the majority (~70%) of genital HSV transmissions occur when there is no outward sign of an infection.","There are two very closely related strains of HSV and typically oral-facial lesions (cold sores) are due to HSV type 1, while genital lesions are caused by HSV type 2.",Infectious Diseases,Health,Diseases & Conditions,,,,information

My cousin got her Hernia and colostomy surgery in India by a company called Forerunners Healthcare .The Price for Minimal Invasive and Laparoscopy surgery is very less in India. She paid 25% of the cost she was quoted in America.

Forerunners Healthcare is very famous in India. They arrange Hernia, Appendectomy, Thyroid and other laparoscopy surgery for foreigners in India.
I read a lot about them in the Newspapers and about their patient stories. They arrange financing for USA, Canadian, UK and other international patients who plan to have surgery abroad for low price, as the Hernia, Colostomy and other minimal invasive surgery is not covered by insurance. They also have photos pasted of their International patients. You can checkout their website. There are huge cost savings. As a doctor I personally believe that surgery can be easily handled in India, as the quality of healthcare available In India is simply best in the world.

How and why does clotting start in the uterus and causes a pulmonary embolus?,,"clotting starts in the uterus (or anywhere else inthe body) by the clotting cascade.  these are many factors that regulate the clotting in the body.  the intrinsic and the extrinsic factors with calcium being common to both.  clotting occurs because the body recognizes that the blody is bleeding somewhere and hasn't stopped.  This starts the cascade.
Blood clots (emboli) are partsof clots thathave broken off and travel through the blood vessels (either venous or arterial) and stop where their size becomes and issue with the tube they are in.  Venous clots are generally safer than arterial, however, both have their consequences.  in your ?, the clots break off and travel to the pulmnonary vasculature...depending on how small, you may experience a twinge (or nothing at all) to sudden dealth by the 'saddle embolis' that now occludes both pulmonary arteries.
heparin or coumadin are acute treatments and aspirin is a mild thinner (does notprevent clotting, but makes the cascade a little slower)

It's good not to use douche. Natural secretions flush germs out of the vagina just fine. If you use douche, instead of rinsing out the vagina, what happens is the douche pushes the germs further up into your reproductive tract. Even if you don't kill good bacteria, douche is bad because it spread bacteria (good and BAD) far into your reproductive tract (vagina, uterus, oviducts). Infections can spread and get really bad, and turn into pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). PID can make you permanently infertile!

If you want to have children someday, then stop douching. A vagina is supposed to smell like a vagina.

Anyone know if Splenda/Equal causes tooth decay like regular sugar?,Since they're not real sugar do they cause cavities like regular sugar would?,"I'm a dentist.

There is no way someone's ""friend"" could do a ""science project"" studying whether or not sugar substitutes cause tooth decay....unless of course this ""friend"" had an entire lab with support staff and thousands of dollars worth of equipment.

Modern dental researchers use rats in carefully controlled environments.  They test for the effects of various materials on rats' teeth by sacrificing the rats and examining the teeth under electron microscopes...among other techniques.  It's not some high school science project like seeing which soil makes plants grow faster.

The answer to your question is ""no"".

These sweeteners, as far as I know, cannot be metabolized by the bacteria that cause tooth decay.

Tooth decay is caused by bacterial metabolism producing lactic acid as a waste product.  This lactic acid is what lowers the pH at the surface of your tooth and causes breakdown of the tooth structure.  If the bacteria residing on your teeth are not provided with food they can metabolize, then they cannot produce lactic acid and thus, cannot cause tooth decay.","If the bacteria residing on your teeth are not provided with food they can metabolize, then they cannot produce lactic acid and thus, cannot cause tooth decay.",Dental,Health,Dental,,,,information

my dad has a mechanical heart valve is this hereditary?,my dad has had a mechanical heart valve about 12 years now he had rumaticfever and thats what caused him to have damage to his valve i never had rumatic fever is this hereditary what is the chance of me getting a heart valve problem,"hi puff,
You dont need to worry.  The answer above is right.  Rheumatic fever is caused by untreated strep throat infection.  Nowadays, its pretty uncommon thanks to simple antibiotic treatment.  The problem is definitely NOT hereditary.  In fact, it can't even be spread from person to person because by the time someone has rheumatic fever, the bacteria is long gone.

A VERY small percent of people with untreated strept throat develop rheumatic fever.  The bacteria itself doesn't infect the heart or its valves.  Rather, your body's immune response to fight off the bacteria accidentally damages your valves.  The valves most commonly affected are the mitral (and sometimes tricuspid) valves.","In fact, it can't even be spread from person to person because by the time someone has rheumatic fever, the bacteria is long gone.",Heart Diseases,Health,Diseases & Conditions,,,,information

What viral infection involves a pinpoint red rasied rash all over with diarrhea and vomiting?,,"Scarlet Fever is a particular strain of Group A streptococcus bacteria.  It is the usual strep throat, just with a red rash all over.  May be some nausea and vomiting, but usually not diarrhea.  There has to be the very sore throat.  Treatment is penicillin.

It is common to see a viral syndrome which has been inapropriately treated with antibiotics, usually amoxicillin or ampicillin, and have a drug reaction which is a red rash like you describe.

Otherwise, who knows.  Presumably he has been immunized against measles?  They get pretty sick with measles.

Treatment depends on how sick he is.  Since he has diarrhea and vomiting, you need to get him off all solid foods and dairy products.  Put him on clear liquids, any thing he can hold down.  Start with a little pedialyte or 7UP with the bubbles stirred out of it.  The clear liquid diet will get his stomach and bowels quieted down.  Then if he can tolerate it, give him a little chicken soup.

    * become darker, lighter, or patchy; change color from brown to blue, black, red, or white
    * develop an irregular or dark spreading border
    * itch
    * turn into a scab and not heal for weeks

The proton pump inhibitors work by completely blocking the production of stomach acid. They do this by inhibiting (shutting down) a system in the stomach known as the proton pump.

First, 'poop' is brown because it is a mixture of green and rusty red.  The red comes from retired blood cells that are being excreted.

How come guys have nipples?,My bro told me to ask this...yea thats it...my bro.

Human beings, male and female start developing the same way.  At an early time in fetal life, hormones are secreted and the fetus differentiates into male or female.  What is even more surprising is that basically, all humans start off as females, and then develop into males, as the hormones kick in during fetal life.  Men are bascally degenerates from the female form....a fact well known to embryologists.  That is, if the male hormone was not present at early development, then the fetus would become a female.  [let's see if your bro can sleep after this!]  Since we all start with the same 'template', some organs are vestigial...nipples being one of those organs.

And, do you know that if you take estrogens (the female hormone) you can actually grow functional breasts?.  Mind boggling, huh?!  Try to sleep now!!!

I used a product called Obagi NuDerm in combination with Retin A-Micro(to quicken the reproduction of skin cells, not to treat acne)over a period of three months to stellar results.

Obagi was a topical skin scare treatment that included washes, ointments and toner.  You can read about it here:

A girlfriend of mine seeking more quick and aggressive treatment (she is in the entertainment industry) tried an Obagi blue peel, and all of her marks were gone within weeks.

It sounds like you're not making enough natural lubrication.  Perhaps you and your partner are getting 'to it' a bit too fast, and you're not giving your body enough time to get worked up and produce some lubrication... 
Next time, take it slow, play around, and get nice and excited first.
Also, some women simply have that problem and can't produce enough lubrication themselves. Go get a bottle of KY Jelly or something simliar (your local drugstore should carry it) and have him put it on.  Do NOT use petrolium jelly (vasoline) with a latex condom!)
The burning you feel is probably either the lack of wetness OR, I suspect that if you're getting minor tearing at the beginning before you get wet enough, then it's the coating/spermicide on the condom. Imagine salt on a cut, that's the picture.

what is the cure to the skin disease pelagra?,,"Since pellagra is a disorder brought about by niacin deficiency. The treatment would be to supplement the individual's diet with a form of niacin called niacinamide (niacin itself in pure supplementation form causes a number of unpleasant side effects, including sensations of itching, burning, and flushing). The niacinamide can be given orally or by injection (when diarrhea would interfere with its absorption). The usual oral dosage is 300-500 mg each day; the usual dosage of an injection is 100-250 mg, administered two to three times each day. When pellagra has progressed to the point of the encephalopathic syndrome, a patient will require 1,000 mg of niacinamide orally, and 100-250 mg of niacinamide by injection. Once the symptoms of pellagra have subsided, a maintenance dose of niacin can be calculated, along with attempting (where possible) to make appropriate changes in the diet. Because many B-complex vitamin deficiencies occur simultaneously, patients will usually require the administration of other B-complex vitamins as well.
Untreated pellagra is fatal, so be sure to go to a doctor immediately and consult on how you would like to be treated","The treatment would be to supplement the individual's diet with a form of niacin called niacinamide (niacin itself in pure supplementation form causes a number of unpleasant side effects, including sensations of itching, burning, and flushing).",Skin Conditions,Health,Diseases & Conditions,,,,treatment

Is a vitamin deficiency linked to dark circles around the entire eye?,,"Most dark circles are caused by the appearance of veins beneath the thin skin under our eyes. As we age and our skin becomes more damaged due to sun exposure, the skin under our eyes becomes thinner and more wrinkled, which allows the veins in this fatty padded area under the eye to appear more prominent. These veins also become more swollen and obvious in people with allergies. Similarly, people with a history of eczema, hay fever or asthma often develop dark circles. They do, of course, become more apparent with a lack of sleep. In some people with dark skin, circles under the eye may actually be due to superficial pigmentation of the skin and not the underlying veins.

Any insight to my dilemma?,"It is not typical for a period to last only a few hours, but everyone is different.  It sounds like you're spotting rather than actually getting your period.  Since you're a virgin, it is also unlikely that you're pregnant. ;)

Doctors consider it abnormal if you don't bleed for more than six months, so if it continues for two more months then you may want to see your family doctor or gynecologist.  

You mention that you're not athletic, are you obese?  Obesity can stop periods just like being too skinny can, so that could be a reason.

Or, you could just have an irregular or very light flow and be lucky.  If you are in your teens this is very normal.","Obesity can stop periods just like being too skinny can, so that could be a reason.",Women's Health,Health,Women's Health,,,,information

Why does my wife have alzheimer's disease?,We've been married for 54 years.,"The cause of Alzheimer’s disease is not known, but several theories of causality have been advanced. These theories propose genetic, environmental, viral, immunological, biochemical, and other causes for the disease.
The specific features of Alzheimer’s disease vary from individual to individual, but the general course of the disease is fairly consistent in most cases. The symptoms of the disease tend to be more severe at night. The first stage of Alzheimer’s disease is usually forgetfulness, accompanied by some anxiety and mild depression. This usually develops into a more serious loss of memory, especially of recent events, moderate spatial and temporal disorientation, loss of ability to concentrate, aphasia, and increased anxiety. This set of symptoms is usually followed by profound spatial and temporal disorientation, delusions, hallucinations, incontinence, general physical decline, and death.

A clear, thin membrane called the conjunctiva covers your eyeball and the inside of your eyelids. If something irritates this covering, your eyes may become red and swollen. Your eyes also may itch, hurt or water. This is called conjunctivitis. It is also known as ""pink eye.""

When an allergen causes the irritation, the condition is called allergic conjunctivitis. This type of conjunctivitis is not contagious. Some common allergens include: pollen from trees, grass and ragweed; animal skin and secretions such as saliva; perfumes and cosmetics; skin medicines; air pollution; and smoke.

It truly depends on what sorts of things they've done before having had intercourse.

The problem is, intercourse is not always the first time something has penetrated a woman's vagina (sorry for the explicitness of the description).

Incidentally the two halves are linked by a channel called the corpus collosum and both sides act to a degree in tandem. Women have been shown to have greater activity in the right side of their brains, proven by MRI scans (magnetic resonance indicator). It has been suggested that from primate times there was a greater inclination toward the right side in women due to evolotionary pressure to nurture and be compassionate, conversely males were more inclined to hunt and those males with greater sense of logic were more succesful.

You can swim, sleep, even have sex with it in. There is no danger of Toxic Shock Syndrome. The only draw back is that it is messy when you take it out. It is a cup that collects the menstrual blood, and there is not cotton-like material that absorbs it. I get around the messy factor by simply changing them during my morning shower. Check it out.

My M.D. asked me for a Thyroid check up. He claims Lithium is harmful for the Thyroid Glad. Any M.D. Answer ?,"I will greatly appreciate other M.D.'s opinion whether this is so.
Got to take Lithium for the rest of my life and I've been having uncontrolled jerks while asleep and my Doctor is afraid that Lithium may be causing those sudden changes in my breathing rithm and uncontroled muscle movements. I only take much less than prescribed (just 150 milligrams a day )
When I don't take it I get depressed and can not eat nor sleep. Please HELP !!!","It is true that lithium can affect the thyroid gland (potentially making it underactive); and it can also affect your kidneys - this is why anyone on lithium should have periodic blood tests for thyroid and renal function, regardless of any symptoms. If your thyroid gland DOES become underactive, it is usually a simple matter to supplement with levothyroxine daily; and is therefore not such a big deal.
Generally the benefits of lithium in people with bipolar disorder or difficult to treat depression are considered to outweigh these risks; and this is why many millions of people are (safely) on lithium. This is especially true if you take a lower-than-average dose (as you do); because the chances of potential harmful side-effects ARE lowered with lower serum lithium levels.
The 'jerks' you mention dont sound related to your thyroid OR your lithium levels (which usually causes tremor if too high); but there is no harm in checking up on these.

It is usually painful for the sufferer especially blacks.,"The first effective drug treatment for adults with severe sickle cell anemia was reported in early 1995, when a study conducted by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute showed that daily doses of the anticancer drug hydroxyurea reduced the frequency of painful crises and acute chest syndrome. Patients taking the drug needed fewer blood transfusions.
I am sorry to say this that there is no cure for this. Although there is no cure for sickle cell anemia, doctors can do a great deal to help patients, and treatment is constantly being improved. Basic treatment of painful crises relies heavily on painkilling drugs and oral and intravenous fluids to reduce pain and prevent complications.

- Blood Transfusions 
- Oral Antibiotics

This condition affects the lower legs and anal region. In other words, wearing gloves and gum boots and overalls did nothing,even the gloves did little to protect us .","It sounds like an eczema caused perhaps by taking showers that are too long and too hot. See what the derm folks say, they should be able to nail it. If it is what I think, then use a bath oil instead of bar soap, and apply a lotion the doc will be able to prescribe afterwards.

Wrinkled Fingers when swimming?,Why do your fingers (and toes) always wrinkled up when in the water for long periods?,"Your skin is too soft and there is a layer between your bones and skin whick absorbs water when you are in water. When the layer has absorbed enough water, it starts to send out the excess water to the skin. As the skin is too soft to contain water, it creates wrinkles in your skin and your wrinkles can hold water.

If you were in the water for a very long time, you would see cuts in your skin. This is because, when the wrinkles cannot hold the rest of the water, they cut portions of your skin and let the water flow out again.
