People eat during races in order to have their glycogen replenished.  But it would defnitely be unhealthy to stay in such a glycogen-depleted state, and you'd have a massive buildup of the stress hormone cortisol -- which, oddly enough, causes the body to store fat.

Baking soda is a natural bleach, so it actually can not do any harm for you!\n\n2)Have you tried hydrogen peroxide (Sp?). It too works great. If you mix them together on your toothbrush you will have a white smile.

    "bestanswer": "Depends on the drug use (frequency and dosages) and the test.  On cheap and inefficient tests, you may be perceived as clear within days, but we have some tests that are looking for any trace residual amounts and it may take months or years for some common drugs to be cleaned out.  Some of the new non-tobacco user drug tests that life insurance companies use will raise flags if a person has used tobacco in the past 2-5 years!  With the motivation that some companies face (government contracts for instance), some are using some pretty sophisticated tests for common drugs and they may be just about as sensitive.  I worked for one company where there were three long-time users and they had little to fear because our \"screenings\" were cheap and not random.  They got by undetected for years (one got sloppy and showed up to work while still high and the other almost terminally OD'ed at home one weekend and it hit the newspapers)--semiannual tests didn't catch them because they were clean by the time the scheduled samples were taken.\n\nSome of the chemicals people use, however, are of types and sophistication that you practically have to be intentionally looking for them, but most opiates have chemical signatures that if a person is using at all, some tests, though definitely not all, will catch you even months later.",

    "subject": "Would this be considered Erectile Dysfunction?",
    "content": "For as long as I can remember when I'm having a sexual experience I typically can not maintain an erection without some kind of stimulation to my penis.  If its being stimulated I can maintain one to ejaculate and as soon as I ejaculate I go totally soft (even when I was a kid this was the case).\n\nI'm wondering if this would be considered ED?  I'm 34, relatively  healthy, a little overweight and I smoke on the weekends.   I take two medicines-propecia and lexapro.   I know the lexapro can reduce your libido which has happened with me but like I said, 90% of the time I can't maintain an erection without the stimulation.\n\nI did some research online about homeopathic remidies and started taking Korean Ginseng 2700mg a day and also got Yohimbe in liquid form.  Has anyone tried either of these?\n\nThanks for your help",
    "bestanswer": "Yes, it is a form of ED. Some men can't get an erection at all and some men can't maintain one. A friend of mine told me once that her husband used a ring at the base of his penis that helped him maintain his erections. I don't know the nice term for it, but the rude one is a *ock ring",

Let a doc check you out though because erectile dysfunction can be a symtom of several diseases, heart problems and diabetes in particular. He will probably say okay and give you a prescription and a sample six pack.

It is generally used to test for autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus, commonly known as SLE or lupus.  A positive test is suggestive of the disease.

Other blood tests for SLE may include anti-rho antibody, anti- dsDNA antibody (anti double stranded DNA antibody), C3 and C4 (complement 3 and complement 4) levels.  The diagnosis of SLE, however, is mainly clinical.  The American Rheumatology Association has a criteria for diagnosing SLE, you'll need to fulfil 4 out of the 11 criteria to be diagnosed with SLE.

There are lots of people on here who just love to give erroneous information, prankers, and some who just don't have a clue about what they are giving advice on.  Be VERY CAREFUL of what medical advice you take from here.\n\nUsually, most hospitals have an \"Ask A Nurse\" program that you can call and ask those types of questions to.  Additionally, why not just wait until you see the doctor, let him/her review the results, and give you the diagnosis and determine what things to test for.\n\nAs a comment.  I am a diabetic and from what I see of your symptoms you MIGHT have diabetic issues also.\n\nMY ADVICE:  Get to a doctor ASAP and let those folks help you and give you the diagnosis, and remedies that you need.\n\nHope this helps.

    "content": "i just started my period im 14 and i dont really\nlike talking to my mom about this...\nhow do u insert a tampon???",
    "bestanswer": "These instructions should make first time tampon insertion easier:\n\n\nFirst, look at the tampon. The larger outer tube that holds the tampon itself at the very end is the top \u2013 this is the part that is inserted into the vagina. Think \u2013 top = tampon. The thinner inside tube is the one where the string is showing. This is the inner or bottom tube \u2013 the part that is used to push the tampon in. \nWash your hands. Stand or sit in a comfortable position. Sit on the toilet with your legs apart and lean slightly forward, or try standing with your knees slightly bent. Standing with one foot up on the tub also works for some girls. Most of the time, you'll end up putting in a tampon while you're on the toilet \u2013 so that's a good place to start. \n\nLook at the tampon applicator again \u2013 you'll see some ridges, this is the finger grip, on the larger tube. With the thumb and middle finger of one hand, hold the applicator lightly on the outer insertion tube at the grip location, with the larger outer tube facing up toward your body and the thinner inner tube pointing down toward the floor. \n\nWith your other hand, gently separate the folds of skin around the vaginal opening. Put the tip of the larger outer tube of the tampon applicator in the opening of the vagina. Are you still breathing?! Don't forget to! It helps you stay relaxed.\n\nThe vagina slants upward and toward the back. So, aim the tampon toward a point low on the small of your back (the curved area of your lower back). Now, take a deep breath, let it out, and relax. Then gently push the larger, outer tube of the applicator into the vagina. Stop when your thumb and middle finger are touching the vaginal opening. \nNOTE: For flushable (cardboard) applicator tampons, ease in the applicator by slightly twisting or rotating it from side to side. Don't twist a plastic applicator, this slides in best when pushed straight in at the proper angle.\n\n\nNext, put your index finger (or a finger on the other hand) at the end of the inner, thinner tube (where the cord comes out). Push this inner tube slowly until it's completely inside the larger tube. This pushes the tampon out of the applicator and into your vagina. Move your finger from the end so that the string hangs free. Keep your thumb and middle finger on the outer tube grip.\n\nNow, holding the tubes (that are now inside each other) firmly but gently remove them from the vagina. (The cardboard tubes can be flushed away.) (IF USING TAMPAX PEARL PLASTIC OR TAMPAX COMPAK, DO NOT FLUSH THE PLASTIC APPLICATOR OR WRAPPER.) Place the used plastic applicator back into the discreet wrapper or wrap it in toilet paper and throw it in the trash.) If the tampon is in correctly, you shouldn't feel it at all. If it feels uncomfortable, it's probably not placed far enough into your vagina. The uncomfortable feeling comes from the tampon rubbing against the muscle at the opening of the vagina. If this happens, remove the tampon and use a fresh one, trying to insert it a little deeper into the vagina.\n\nTo remove a tampon, relax your muscles. Slowly and gently pull the removal string downward at the same angle you used to insert the tampon. Don\u2019t worry about the string \u2013 it\u2019s securely sewn throughout the tampon. If you feel discomfort while removing the tampon, it probably means you didn\u2019t need to change it because it hadn\u2019t absorbed enough yet. You may either want to wear a tampon longer next time or use a lower absorbency.",

      "I have had PCOS since my doctor diagnosed me with it in 1973.  I did not seek treatment back then, because I had no medical insurance.  He told me that if I wanted to get pregnant, to get some insurance and see him.  I did not use any method of birth control because he told me I probably wouldn't be able to get pregnant.  Well, I did get pregnant on my own in May of 1974!!!  The hardest symptom to live with for me was the hirsutism.  I have spent thousands getting hair laser, so I don't have a problem with that anymore!",
      "I am 18 years old and was diagnosed with PCOS in January.  I started my period when I was 13 for a couple of years it was regular and then when I turned 16 I would go for sometimes 7-8 months without a period at all.  I finally got tired of being so irregular, since I had no normal cycle I would start when I least expected it (for example school, vacations,) and I just could handle it anymore.  I went to the gynecologist and she perscribed me the Yasmin birth contol pill.  I absoultley LOVE it!  One symptom I had before birth contol was a lot of pain when I was highly active, for example jogging or running now I have no pain.  I also had pretty bad acne and the pill has helped so much with that too. I highly reccomend it for you.  Women with PCOS do usually have problems getting pregnant but I have heard that there is a drug called Clomid that can help with that, I don't know much about it...but I would like to know more.

    "bestanswer": "Hi there. Try this.\n\nThe naturopathic approach to Candida infection is to improve resistance to infection, whilst at the same time addressing the overgrowth of the Candida organism.\n\n\nProbiotics such as acidophilus and bifidus bacteria are \"good\" bacteria that normally inhabit the digestive tract and the vagina. Probiotic supplementation may help to address the imbalance caused by an overgrowth of Candida, and may help relieve digestive symptoms such as flatulence and diarrhoea.\n\nThe mineral chromium assists the body with sugar utilisation and may help to reduce sugar craving symptoms; (if you are diabetic, discuss this with your healthcare professional before using it)\n\nThe herb garlic has anti-fungal properties and is prescribed to assist with fungal infections such as Candida\n\nEchinacea stimulates the body's resistance and may help to reduce susceptibility to infection\n\nImportant Notes\nMany antibacterial, corticosteroid and immuno-suppressive therapies increase susceptibility to Candida, as do pregnancy, diabetes and some other diseases. Consult with your healthcare professional if you have concerns in this regard.\n\n\nIn certain individuals, such as those with depleted immunity, Candida infection may require immediate medical attention.\n\n\n\nRecurrent thrush is sometimes due to an infected sexual partner - both people may need to be treated before the situation is resolved. \n\n\n\nRecurrent thrush in babies may indicate that the mother's nipples are infected. Your healthcare professional will prescribe a suitable topical preparation.\n\nPrevention\nCandida is more likely to develop in warm, moist environments. Try to wear cotton rather than nylon underwear, and always ensure a baby's nappy is changed as quickly as possible.\n\n\n\nA healthy diet and lifestyle combined with good hygiene will reduce the likelihood of developing Candida. Avoid excessive amounts of yeast-based foods such as bread and try not to eat too many sugary foods.\n Hope this helps.\n\nCraig - Naturopath",

    "subject": "Do I have skin cancer?",
    "content": "I went to the doctor a week ago to have two odd moles looked at. She decided to do an incisional biopsy on them. Yesterday the doc called and said that one of them was a \"highly atypical nevus\" and that I should come back ASAP to get more tissue removed with a margin. I'm going in tomorrow to do that. When I asked what that means, she said that we'd talk about it in person. Now I'm worried.\n\nI'm only 26, but I have a lot of risk factors for skin cancer--family history, blue eyes and red hair, pale skin and freckles, many many bad sunburns, congenital nevi (moles I was born with), and a precancerous mole that was removed 7 years ago. That's why I keep a close eye on my skin and went to the doc in the first place. \n\nDoes this mean that I have (or probably have) skin cancer?",
    "bestanswer": "First, \"naevus\" or \"nevus\" just means a pigmented lesion on your skin, like a birth mark. Most are benign. However, when she called, she obviously had gotten some suspicious pathology reports back, and wants to take a closer look. Getting a sample with a border allows her to compare your normal cells with those of the area she's testing. When she takes the sample, they preserve it (usually in alcohol), then embed it in a parafin block, and take very very thin slices of it with a microtome blade. These slices are mounted on microscope slides, and a pathologist reviews them for signs of malignancy. \n  There are some things you can look at on your own body, though. They're called the ABC's of skin cancer, and diagnosticians and general practitioners learn them in med school. A = asymmetry (the mole is not a circle or oval, but blebbs, and has an inconsistent shape) B = Border (if the border is not smooth, it may signal a problem) and C = colour (color changes in nevi are not good. normal colors are shades of brown, turning red or black can signal a problem). These rules are not hard and fast, but serve as a good tool. \n\nGood luck.",

Keep the fever down with paracetamol and give more fluids and soft , bland diet. As for dengue, it presents with high grade fever, intractible vomiting and severe body ache, including pain in the eyeballs. There may also be pain in the abdomen. Platelets in the blood may be low, leading to bruising, bluish spots in the skin and bleeding from different sites. In the second week, fever goes down and platelets go up. In the second week, rarely, there is shock and unconsciousness. If you are worried about dengue, get blood CP asnd platelet count done. If platelets are low, get the test for dengue done.

      "I was a NCAA basketball player and suffered literally hundreds of sprains in my career from highschool through college. \n\nI never really saw any dramatic results with electric stim. I know that a lot of physical therapists use galvanic stim to help bones heal faster, but I don't know what that has to do with an ankle sprain. \n\nFor years I searched for a method to heal my sprained ankles fast, but then I started looking for a way to rehab them so that I did not have sprained ankles. \n\nI found this article that tells how to rehab your sprained ankles fast. Maybe it will help. \n\nhttp://searchwarp.com/swa39823.htm\n\nFirst you need to reduce the swelling. Then you need to restore complete range of motion in your ankle by using a wobble board. The wobble board also helps to retrain your brain to understand the position of your ankle. Type in wobble board on yahoo.com search engine and you will find a lot to choose from. You don't need an expensive one, they all do the same thing. Mine cost less than $20.00.\n\nMake sure you strengthen both of your ankles or you are doomed to alternating sprains from one foot to another like I did."

But will this liquid stuff \"detoxify\" ALL chemicals in the body including those? Should I just say I'm not on any prescriptions?

    "bestanswer": "Queen Crystal,\n\nFirst of all, do everything you can to take the trip.  You deserve it.  Your symptoms are classic Parkinson's.  I know that you specifically asked for people that have PD.  I just do a lot of research about PD, and work with PWPs all the time.  So, please discount my answer if you really value first-hand experience.  \n\nProblems with balance and walking are some of the inevitable consequences of PD.  They are very frustrating.  Your experiences with fatigue and low blood pressure are something that many other people living with PD experience.  \n\nI do not know what you are doing now for exercise.  However, fine tunning with exercise before you go may help.  Also, talk to your physician about your trip.  She/he may have recommendations.  I recently talked to a patient's wife that says that the Apokyn injection has saved them many times.  \n\nPlease feel free to contact me via Yahoo 360, or my blog - MyParkinsonsInfo.com.  We could talk some more.  Thanks!\n\nMatt\nMy Parkinson's Info",

    "content": "Ok I have scoliosis and I have to see a chiropractor twice a week. My back hurts very very bad most of the day. I can't walk around and for long periods of time without siiting down. I don't like having to take pain killers all of the times so I stay in pain. \n I'm only a teenager and this pain has really effected my life. I can no longer participate in sports anymore because of the never ending pain. A car wreck a year ago damaged my back even more. I exercise 30 minutes every day to stay in good shape. And I eat healthy foods.\n  Is there any way to help my back, or do I have to live with this?",
    "bestanswer": "I would suggest you seek a trained massage therapist to work in conjunction with your chiropractor.  If you can get the muscles in your back to release some of the tension they are putting on your spine, it might help to make the chiropractic adjustments more effective.  Sounds like you could have some spastic muscles in your back, and massage would definately help in that area, besides the fact that massage is very beneficial for circulation, and a state of relaxation.  Hope this info. helps.  I'm a certified massage therapist with a couple of clients that suffer from scoliosis.  God Bless.",

It was done by two Docs that had good reputations and after a couple years of research, they were the only ones that took my insurance. They completely screwed up the surgery and I never lost weight, so I didn't have to tell friends. Only my family knows. Now I am in extream pain and having a surgery to try to repair it. This time I have one of the best Doctors in the world operating on me.\n\nThe thing is I don't want some people to know that I'm having a correction to weight loss surgery. When I had the first surgery, I was riduculed by several people saying that I took the easy way out. Believe me, it hasn't been easy. I've tried every diet in the world plus having a nighmare surgery and months of pain only to be told by those who know that it is my own fault.\nIt's going to take several weeks to recover.

    "content": "In 2001 I started Depo-provera (birth control shot) and developed hives.  My doctor said that it couldn't possible be related to the shot.  He sent me to a dermatologist.  He said, stop the shot and they'll go away.  They did, for about two years.  Then I started to get hives again with no cause that we could figure out.  Eventually these faded.  Last June (2005) when I had my daughter, I broke out again, and have had them daily since.  Have now seen 4 different doctors, no answers.  Two weeks agao, I started birth control pills.  I just stopped nursing my baby, and don't want to get pregnant yet.  Now I'm covered in hives again that won't go away.  I stopped the pills, started allergy medicine, and steroid cream with NO relief.  Any suggestions?  Anyone with similar experiences?",
    "bestanswer": "It isn't really possible to have a true allergy to those things because they are just hormones...your body already has these hormones.  What sounds like might be happening is when you have an increased level of hormones (when you took depo, bc pills and had your baby) your body reacted to it by getting hives.  I might go see an endocrinologist, which is a doctor that specializes in hormones.  You could go see an allergist too.",

      "Genital herpes is a sexually transmitted disease (STD) caused by the herpes simplex viruses type 1 (HSV-1) and type 2 (HSV-2). Most genital herpes is caused by HSV-2. Most individuals have no or only minimal signs or symptoms from HSV-1 or HSV-2 infection. When signs do occur, they typically appear as one or more blisters on or around the genitals or rectum. The blisters break, leaving tender ulcers (sores) that may take two to four weeks to heal the first time they occur. Typically, another outbreak can appear weeks or months after the first, but it almost always is less severe and shorter than the first outbreak. Although the infection can stay in the body indefinitely, the number of outbreaks tends to decrease over a period of years.",
      "Well, to begin with you may feel a tingling itchy annoyance in your genital area. You will probably start to notice that the itchy areas begin to bump up and fill with a yellowish puss. The soars will form in little clusters and eventually break open and form raw feeling ulcers. The ulcers will then scab over and may even get sticky and rip open again. The full outbreak will last anywhere from 2-6 weeks. If someone has it for a while and takes notice of the symptoms they will notice certain areas other than your genitals will ache and hurt (arms, legs, etc) The aching is because the disease is bread in the nervous system so you feel it in you whole body. If you do find that you or anyone you know has genital herpes, the best form of treatment is Valtrax start treatment as soon as possible because the longer you wait the harder it is to treat. It is not a \"cure\" but it will prevent future outbreaks.",
      "well, it sometimes can be hard to determine. There is a thing called prodrone.  This is tingling, burning or ichy feeling before the actual blister appear. I will usually get som kind of \"weird\" feeling down below just before I get an outbreak.  When I was first diagnosed with hsv, i found a great web site that really helped. its ww.racoon.com. this is a message board where you can communicate with others."

    "bestanswer": "Here are some tips to relieving your symptoms:\n\n1.Eat frequent small meals every 2 or 3 hours. \n\n2.Avoid strong odours. \n\n3.Stand up slowly and do not lie down immediately after eating. \n\n4.Speak to your healthcare provider about your symptoms and how they affect you. He or she can recommend a safe and effective medication to treat your nausea and/or vomiting and to prevent the progression of the disease. \n\n5.Eat dry crackers 15 minutes before getting out of bed in the morning. \n\n6.Do not skip meals needlessly. \n\n7.Drink fluids \u00bd hour before a meal or \u00bd hour after a meal. Avoid drinking during your meal. \n\n8.Drink about 8 glasses of liquid during the day to avoid dehydration. \n\n9.Do not hesitate to eat what you want when you want it, even if you are craving foods that are not part of your regular diet. \n\n10.Try eating cold food rather than hot food (cold food have less odour). \n\n11.If odours bother you while cooking, try to improve ventilation in the kitchen area. \n\n12.If it is possible, get assistance in the preparation of your meal. \n\n13.NVP may worsen when you get overtired. Try to increase resting periods and take more naps during the day. \n\n14.Should you decide to take medication for your NVP, there is a safe and effective product available in Canada, Diclectin\u00ae (a combination of vitamin B6 and an antihistamine, doxylamine). This is prescribed specifically for your NVP by your healthcare professional. \n\n15.If nothing else works for you, ask your provider about taking an anti-nausea medication that's considered safe during your first trimester. \n\n16.Finally, if your symptoms persist or worsen consult your healthcare professional. \n\nIf you are seeking specific information, post a question in the \"Do You Have a Question for Dr. Gargaun?\" section.\n\nSOS Morning Sickness http://www.sosmorningsickness.com/steps.html\n\nP.S.

    "bestanswer": "not too common, here is info from the experts...\n\nUndescended testicle\n \nMy nephew's son was born with only one testicle. What causes this? Can it be treated?\n- No name / No state given\n  Mayo Clinic pediatrician Jay Hoecker, M.D., and colleagues answer select questions from readers.\nAnswer\nDuring male fetal development, the testicles (testes) form in the abdomen. In the final months before birth, they typically move down into the scrotum. But sometimes one testicle fails to fully descend. At birth, it remains up in the abdomen or only part way down toward the scrotum. Doctors refer to this as an undescended testicle (cryptorchidism). Up to 30 percent of boys born prematurely \u2014 and 4 percent of full-term male infants \u2014 have an undescended testicle.\n\nThis condition usually corrects itself without treatment within the first year of life. If this doesn't occur, treatment may include:\n\nInjections of a hormone called human chorionic gonadotropin to stimulate movement of the testicle into the scrotum \nSurgery to relocate the testicle to the scrotum \nIf both testicles are undescended in a newborn male, a doctor may recommend tests to confirm the baby's sex and to identify the location of the testes.\n\nA male with only one healthy testicle can still have normal erections and make adequate sperm to conceive a child. However, potential health concerns in a male with an undescended testicle include:\n\nIncreased risk of testicular cancer, even if the testicle has been surgically relocated \nAn undescended testicle could twist and impair blood flow to the testicle (testicular torsion) \nhttp://www.mayoclinic.com/health/undescended-testicle/AN00556",

I'm going to an oral surgeon tomorrow.... i just want him to take it out tomorrow.  i don't want to have to wait to see if there is an infection and i don't want them to wait for it to go away.  i've had a huge filling on my left side for the last 8 years with no problems.  all of this shifting i guess has caused some major pain in that tooth too.  do you thnk i'll need a root canal now?  to tell you about how much pain i'm in.... 6 ibproufen doesn't help...and i've been eating pudding since wed.!!! I'm scared!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",

Both are doing extremely fine since 1 year.\n\nMy cousin also got her knee surgery for acl repair in India through the forerunners healthcare .SHe is more than very happy with the results.She just paid 25% of the amount she was quoted in USA and is all praise for this forerunners healthcare company.hope this helps \n\nhttp://www.forerunnershealthcare.com"

    "content": "If yes/no please explain your reason. Best answer to me will recieve 10 pts! ;D",
    "bestanswer": "There is definitely a possibility of curing herpes. First of all, all viruses share certain characteristics that make them susceptible to improving antiviral treatment. Secondly, we are able to cure some viruses like Hepatitis C. Just a few years ago, we didn't even know how to identify Hep C.\n\nA global vaccine program can eradicate herpes, much like smallpox. But I think that we are making great strides in virology. It's only a matter of time.\n\nI would be hard for me to explain the scientific basis for this but I'll try. Consider that there was a discovery of a major protein component of the HSV virion in 1999. It is now known that HSV induces and then prevents apoptosis (death of a cell) during its replication cycle. As we're starting to understand this process of replication and reactivation, we are learning how to interfere with the molecular pathways that may lead to a cure of HSV.\n\nAlso consider that HSV is not heavily funded research. Dramatic diseases like HIV and Avian Flu will always get more attention and more money. But we have made incredible strides in HIV and influenza. Think about it, HIV patients can now live a normal life span. We have identified the cause of avian flu and now we're working on its prevention. \n\nUnlike cancer, which seems to come out of nowhere, viruses are easier to study. There's a whole branch of medicine going beyond viruses in order to study an even smaller cousin called \"prions\". As nanotechnology improves, we'll soon be able to study these microscopic organisms. \n\nBe patient. There will be a cure.",

It will happen, undoubtedly, and probably in the not too distant future.\n\nIf you have a cold and take nyquil and all the symptoms go away you feel okay.  If a way to stop the spread of a cold were developed along with it the common cold wouldn't be cured but without being able to spread it it would become obsolete.  With Herpes only the symptoms are the problem so to get rid of the symptoms would get rid of the disease, and even the carrier wouldn't need to worry.",

      "Hi,\n\nI totally know where you're coming from.  I struggled with really, really bad acne about 2 years ago.  Intially I tried tetra-cyclin and retin-a.  However, my skin got freakishly dry and I started getting a weird rash on my face.  \n\nI quickly stopped taking them and tried Proactive.  That sure was a waste of money.  I finally started showering directly after the gym and found that this helped tremendously.  I also tried a free product I got on the net called Beautiful Skin.  Believe it or not, it worked way better than the prescription stuff!  I only paid $4.95 for shipping for a month supply.  I re-ordered and I use it to make sure I don't get back my zits.  It also has tea tree oil which feels really good on my skin.\n\nHere's the link if you want to get it, I think it's the best thing I've ever bought for the price $4.95\nhttp://www.alllsite.info/beautiful-skin.php\n\nGood Luck!",
      "If you\u2019re looking for accurate acne information, best to see a dermatologist. Some people believe doctors are predisposed to take the easy way to deal with acne\u2026 prescription drugs. But, with many, this simplistic answer may not be the appropriate course of action. Some feel that such prescription drugs just treat the symposium and not the underlying cause. But, a local dermatologist is still your best starting point.\n\nFor me personally, I discovered a great informational acne treatment site. Not only is there good information/articles but I got their audio e-book and following it\u2019s advice can now say that my acne is a thing of the past! Keep in mind, were all different and there are various types of acne, so what works for some may not be totally effective for all.\n\nBottom line, hang in there, you will get past this! Sincere best wishes and good luck.\nOh, by the way the site that helped me is:\nhttp://www.acne-treatment-medicine-1.info\n\nhttp://www.medical-research-study-directory.info/\nhttp://www.lasik-surgery-san-diego.info/\nhttp://www.san-diego-dentist.us\nhttp://www.san-diego-plastic-surgery-cosmetic-surgery-doctors.us/",
      "I struggled with acne for years and I finally found the solution that works for me. We have been fooled, tricked, deceived, and just plain lied to. It's time that someone put a stop to it, and everyone learn the truth!\n\nThose of us who suffer from acne have usually been given 2 choices and neither of them work:\n\n1. Over the counter remedies such as cleansers, creams, ointments, etc. These things have been proven over and over again not to work. Why? It does not address the root cause of the problem.\n\n2. Go see a doctor and or dermatologist. They will generally prescribe prescription drugs which include topicals and or antibiotics. This, too, has been proven over and over again not to work. Why? It does not address the root cause of the problem.\n\nI found a step-by-step program that cured my acne and it has never come back. It is amazing and doesn\u2019t use any drugs or doctors. The truth is that acne can be cured\u2026if we know the secret the doctors and drug companies don\u2019t want us to know.\n\nThere is a great website: http://cure-my-acne.info/3daycure/  that has all the details. I really suggest you check it out and see if it works as well for you as it did for me."

    "content": null,
    "bestanswer": "What causes diarrhea?\nDiarrhea may be caused by a temporary problem, like an infection, or a chronic problem, like an intestinal disease. A few of the more common causes of diarrhea are\n\nBacterial infections. Several types of bacteria, consumed through contaminated food or water, can cause diarrhea. Common culprits include Campylobacter, Salmonella, Shigella, and Escherichia coli.\n\n\nViral infections. Many viruses cause diarrhea, including rotavirus, Norwalk virus, cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex virus, and viral hepatitis.\n\n\nFood intolerances. Some people are unable to digest some component of food, such as lactose, the sugar found in milk.\n\n\nParasites. Parasites can enter the body through food or water and settle in the digestive system. Parasites that cause diarrhea include Giardia lamblia, Entamoeba histolytica, and Cryptosporidium.\n\n\nReaction to medicines, such as antibiotics, blood pressure medications, and antacids containing magnesium.\n\n\nIntestinal diseases, like inflammatory bowel disease or celiac disease.\n\n\nFunctional bowel disorders, such as irritable bowel syndrome, in which the intestines do not work normally.\n\n\nSome people develop diarrhea after stomach surgery or removal of the gallbladder. The reason may be a change in how quickly food moves through the digestive system after stomach surgery or an increase in bile in the colon that can occur after gallbladder surgery.\n\nIn many cases, the cause of diarrhea cannot be found. As long as diarrhea goes away on its own, an extensive search for the cause is not usually necessary.\n\nPeople who visit foreign countries are at risk for traveler's diarrhea, which is caused by eating food or drinking water contaminated with bacteria, viruses, or, sometimes, parasites. Traveler's diarrhea is a particular problem for people visiting developing countries. Visitors to the United States, Canada, most European countries, Japan, Australia, and New Zealand do not face much risk for traveler's diarrhea.",

    "bestanswer": "I work as an infectious disease epidemiologist at a health department, and we deal with these types of things on a daily basis. \n\nFirst, let me say that it is NOT the flu. Flu is a respiratory disease that causes fever, cough and sore throat. Occasionally it can cause vomiting or diarrhea, but the main symptoms are respiratory.\n\nAs for the origin of your illness, it is difficult to say exactly what it is. Viral illness, such as norovirus, tend to last for a couple of days. People generally feel crappy for a few days after, but the vomiting and diarrhea only last a couple days. \n\nBacterial illness like salmonella or E. coli are usually accompanied by a fever. They last longer than viral illnesses, up to several days. There are parasitic illness (giardia for example) than can come and go for months. \n\nIf your illness does not go away, your doctor can order tests to determine the cause. A stool specimen can be cultured for bacterial pathogens, and can be examined for parasites. Most diseases are self-limiting, and go away on their own. Antibiotics are not recommended in most cases, but may be prescribed for severe situations. \n\nYour doctor would be able to help diagnose and treat the illness; if it doesn't go away on it's own, you should seek medical care. In the meantime, get plenty of rest and be sure to drink enough fluids so that you don't become dehydrated. The best thing to use to hydrate yourself is Pedialyte or a similar product.",

    "subject": "how to heal tennis elbow?",
    "content": null,
    "bestanswer": "The best way to relieve tennis elbow is to stop doing anything that irritates your arm \u2014 a simple step for the weekend tennis player, but not as easy for the manual laborer, office worker, or professional athlete.\n\nThe most effective conventional and alternative treatments for tennis elbow have the same basic premise: Rest the arm until the pain disappears, then massage to relieve stress and tension in the muscles, and exercise to strengthen the area and prevent re-injury. If you must go back to whatever caused the problem in the first place, be sure to warm up your arm for at least 5 to 10 minutes with gentle stretching and movement before starting any activity. Take frequent breaks.\n\nConventional medicine offers an assortment of treatments for tennis elbow, from drug injections to surgery, but the pain will never go away completely unless you stop stressing the joint. Re-injury is inevitable without adequate rest.\n\nFor most mild to moderate cases of tennis elbow, aspirin or ibuprofen will help address the inflammation and the pain while you are resting the injury, and then you can follow up with exercise and massage to speed healing.\n\nFor stubborn cases of tennis elbow your doctor may advise corticosteroid injections, which dramatically reduce inflammation, but they cannot be used long-term because of potentially damaging side effects.\n\nAnother attractive option for many sufferers, especially those who prefer to not ingest medication orally, is the application of an appropriate and effective topical anti-inflammatory. CT Cream with A.C.P. was specifically designed to reduce inflammation and does so by taking advantage of well known elements Arnica, Choline, Pyridoxine and Vitamin B6. Researched, formulated and introduced recently by Dr. Ying Lee, CT Cream has proven to be extremely successful in treating inflammation related ailments such as epicondylitis, tendonitis, bursitis & carpal tunnel syndrome.\n\nIf rest, anti-inflammatory medications, and a stretching routine fail to cure your tennis elbow, you may have to consider surgery, though this form of treatment is rare (fewer than 3 percent of patients). One procedure is for the tendon to be cut loose from the epicondyle, the rounded bump at the end of the bone, which eliminates stress on the tendon but renders the muscle useless. Another surgical technique involves removing so-called granulated tissue in the tendon and repairing tears.\n\nEven after you feel you have overcome a case of tennis elbow, be sure to continue babying your arm. Always warm up your arm for 5 to 10 minutes before starting any activity involving your elbow. And if you develop severe pain after use anyway, pack your arm in ice for 15 to 20 minutes and call your doctor.",

      "Also called Lateral Epicondylitis, the treatment is to avoid any activity that hurts on extending or pronating the wrist, and to substitute any exercise that does not cause pain, eg, jogging, cycling, basketball (even racquetball or squash, as the force of the ball on the rackets is less than in tennis). With healing, exercises to strengthen the wrist extensors can be started. Generally, exercises to strengthen the wrist flexor pronators are also recommended. \n\nKeep in mind that this is an overuse injury so it's extremely important to restore the strength and the wrist flexors before initiating the same activity.\n\nhttp://preventdisease.com/fitness/sportinjuries/articles/elbow_injuries.html",
      "According to Dr. John Sarno who has been on tv, radio, and written a few books, tennis elbow is a condition listed under Tension Myotsis Syndrome (TMS).  It is a lack of oxygen in the area that is in pain.  Many other conditions listed also.  His book The Mindbody Prescription explains it all.  It is true pain but the reason for it is quite interesting."

    "content": "Where I work, I have to use the computer a lot, and working my wrists a lot (office work).\nIf I get CTS, and it gets to a point where it affects my work, can I get comphensation for that (from the company)? Can legal action be taken to get comphensation?",
    "bestanswer": "I'm not sure what the legislation is like where you are from, but in Ontario, Canada you can be compensated for this.\nAs long as your doctor can prove that your work caused your CTS then you can be compensated for it. CTS is also a specific injury to the median nerve in your wrists (whereby it affects the muscles), so if those aren't directly affected you cannot be diagnosed with CTS. \nI'm also not really sure about taking \"legal action\" against your employer. The basic reason a compensation board exists is to protect a worker AND the employer. It protects the worker by allowing them to keep their job if they are injured on the job (in the \"olden days\" workers would lose their jobs if they attempted to put the blame on their employers for an injury), on the other hand, it also protects the employer by compensating workers without worrying about being sued if an injury were to arise.\nIt's best to check this out with your local compensation board. In Canada, each province has their own.\nAlso, recognizing that you might get CTS due to your work is a great step is realizing that your workstation needs to be readjusted (see Ergonomics). If your workstation is giving you pain by the end of the day, ask your supervisor or HR to have an ergonomic assessment done to readjust everything in your workplace, this will help to make things more comfortable for you. And if they don't agree to that, kindly remind them that if your problem gets worse you WILL seek compensation for it and that equals lost time from work!",

    "content": "went to a party sat night, no alcohol or anything illegal, only 1 smoke. i had been sick with the flu the last couple days. i went to bed at 3pm and started to uncontrolably shake in my bed for a couple hours, and i wasnt cold. i then woke up to use the restroom and after i was finished i fainted... any idea how this occured? i had never fainted in my life.",
    "bestanswer": "Since you had recently suffered from flu, and having sat around during the party in the night where you could have lost your body\u2019s core temperature.  Your body had reacted to it by curtailing the circulation of the skin (goose pimples) and other non essential parts of the body so conserve heat of your body.  But once you were back in your bed, the outside temperature being returned back to normal, blood would have started flowing out to the skin, which was so far curtailed by your body mechanism.  This caused the body losing heat and this started the shivering and this way the muscular activity generated had built up your core body temperature while diverting your blood to the splanchnic pool (the blood pool which supplies to the viscera of the body).  \n\nNow since your blood was pooled in your visceral area and therefore could not reach the brain in sufficient quantities while you were straining to void your bladder, it caused you a spell of dizziness/fainting.  MICTURATION SYNCOPES are known to occur, but in the old and the frail, after prolonged illnesses, or in those with obstruction like BPH (Benign Prostate Hypertrophy) where one has to strain more to pass out urine through the obstructed tract.   \n\nDo not be unduly worried.  Start taking plenty of warm fluids, soups etc.  Keep your body well protected from cold and do not jump out of the bed, get out slowly and do not hurry.  Do not strain too much while standing to void your bladder.  Good luck.",

It doesn't mean you will get cancer, and it can take up to 20 years for that to develop. they usually do the minimum treatment necessary, if its mild or CIN 1 they may just monitor you as this can reverse its self. Ask if you can be tested for HPV(wart virus) as that is linked to pre cancerous conditions and whether they are likely to turn cancerous. A load of studies in the UK have been looking at this and a vaccine against HPV is being developed. check out all the treatments available too as it is invasive and you need to be happy with what they do. good luck",

    "bestanswer": "yep. Had three. First in 1996, by an orthopedic surgeon, and it was horrible. Plus he left a huge jagged scar. I had to have another surgery in 1997 to fix what he'd done plus remove another one. This time I went to the premier neurosurgeon in Houston, Texas. I was walking the same day, he made my incision all tiny and pretty, and I was good to go for two more years when I had my third in November of 2000. This time, same surgeon, he only removed a fragment that had fallen against the spinal cord and also shaved off multiple bone spurs on my lumbar vertabrae that were damaging my disks when they's occasionally protrude as disks do from time to time.  Again, I was better in almost no time, and haven't had a minute's problem since.\n\nSo--the moral of the story to me is: have your operation performed by a neurosurgeon NOT an orthopedic surgeon. Let them stick with knees and shoulders.\n\nTell your dad all will be well, and best of luck and good wishes. To you too. Waiting outside the OR is the hardest part.",

Right now I am 2 weeks late. I have taken a home pregnancy test, an ept, and it was negative. Now my ovaries feel like they are aching. It's just a constant ache. I thought maybe because if I had started when I was supposed to, this would be the middle of my cycle and I might be ovulating and if so that may be why I am aching so I took an ovulation test to see if I was ovulating and it said no.  The achy feeling has eased off for now but I don't know what is going on and I'm worried and would like to know what things could cause this and what my doctor might say. I am 30 years old, have never been pregnant and have been trying to get pregnant for 4 years.Thanks for helping.",

    "bestanswer": "Look for a (salty) solution. Soak your foot in a mixture of 2 teaspoons salt per pint of warm water. Do this for 5 to 10 minutes at a time, and repeat until the problem clears up. The saline solution helps provide an unappealing atmosphere for the fungus and lessens excess perspiration. What's more, it softens the affected skin, so antifungal medications can penetrate deeper and act more effectively.\n\nMedicate your foot. Now's the time to apply an over-the-counter antifungal medication. The three main types contain either miconazole nitrate (found in Micatin products, for example), tolnaftate (Aftate or Tinactin), or fatty acids (Desenex). Two or three times a day, lightly apply one of them to the whole area involved and rub in gently. Continue for four weeks (or for two weeks after the problem seems gone).\n\nTreat your little piggies. For athlete's foot between your toes, apply an aluminum-chloride solution. This clear liquid not only kills fungus but also helps to dry the area and discourage regrowth. Ask your pharmacist to make up a solution of 25 percent aluminum chloride in water. Use a cotton swab to apply the liquid between your toes two or three times a day. Continue for two weeks after the infection clears up.\n\nRub in baking soda. For fungus on your feet, especially between the toes, apply a baking-soda paste. Take 1 tablespoon of baking soda and add a little lukewarm water. Rub that on the site of your fungus, then rinse and dry thoroughly. Finish off the treatment by dusting on cornstarch or powder.\n\nRemove dead skin. When the acute phase of the attack has settled down. You need to remove any dead skin. \"It houses living fungi that can reinfect you. At bath time, work the entire foot lightly but vigorously with a bristle scrub brush. Pay extra attention to spaces between toes\u2014use a small bottle brush or test-tube brush there.\" If you scrub your feet in the bathtub, shower afterward to wash away any bits of skin that could attack themselves to other parts of the body and start an infection there.\n\nGood luck.",

    "content": "for those of you that dont know what shin splints are its a pain in the middle of the shin which renders the runner to almost walk in agony after trying to run.",
    "bestanswer": "I used to suffer from these quite a bit as well.\n\nShin splints are associated with pain in the anterior tibia caused by overuse of the anterior tibilias muscle. They are most common in inexperienced runners or runners who overtrain. The pain is usually worsened by exertion and other factors:\n\n- Running on hard surfaces\n- Insufficient padding in the shoes \n- Over-pronated and/or flat feet can also lead to increased stress on the lower leg muscles during exercise\n- High arched feet can experience shin splint discomfort because this foot type is a poor shock absorber.\n\nThe treatment for shin splints is rest. Running and other strenuous lower limb activities should be avoided until the pain subsides and is no longer elicited by activity. In conjunction with rest, icing and anti-inflammatories may be suggested by a doctor or trainer, though there is some controversy over their effectiveness. A contributing cause of shin splints in some cases is the relative weakness of the muscles on the anterior of the lower leg compared to those in the calf. In this case exercises that preferentially strengthen the anterior muscles may help alleviate or avoid shin splints.\n\nIf you are just starting to run. Take it easy and progress into a walking program first before running. \n\nThe best advice I give you to start is change your running shoes and go to a specialized store (like the running room) which educate you on the most effective shoe for your foot and running style.\n\nA Rundown on Shin Splints\nhttp://preventdisease.com/news/articles/rundown_shin_splints.shtml",

    "bestanswer": "My son was diagonosed with type 1 at the age of 21 months.\nHe is now 6 years old and in 1st grade.  This year has been  hard for me because he is in school all day. I dont think the nurse in my school system was very prepared. I get phone calls all the time. He gets up at 8am eats, checks his bloodsugar with the meter and dials the insulin pen to the sliding scale. At 1Oam he eats his snack in class. Noon time he goes to the nurse for his bloodsugar check and shot again before lunch.  At 2pm he eats a afternoon snack. School is out at 3pm he comes home does his homework and outside he goes.  At 5pm he gets 2 shots his Lantus long acting insulin and his short acting Novalog and he checks his sugar again.  For the last month he has been checking himself. He is very into sports. We just started basketball after the fall season of soccer. He has been playing t-ball since the age of 4.  My husband and I take turns at the practices because we cant leave him in case of emergency most persons dont know what to do like using the glucagon the pen with the sugar if they are unrespondsive.  I used it one time his sugar was EIGHT yes 8 i thought he was gone about 2 years ago. I hope that never happens again.  His bloodsugars are usually between 100 to 200 which is his target.  Everyone always asks me is it heredity? no it was a virus that just happened and he will never grow out of it.  Hershey Medical Center in Hershey pa says a cure in 5 years.  The shots dont bother him and his classmates are great.  He knows the word Diet or water and he knows not to eat alot of sugar.  I wish some one would do a research paper on the unbeliveable costs of sugar free items.  When he is high he throws things and when he is low he is hot and confused. We are currently looking into the insulin pump for him in Jan.  Hershey Medical has many 3 years on the pump at this time. I just think that is way to early.  any questions u can email me at bluesparkle1973@yahoo.com  im in pa.",

He is having chemo but today he i found out he needs early blood transfusions and he is refusing his medication...could this be a sign things are worsening significantly?? I am just look for people's opinions as i do not live close by to my dad and dont speak to his doctor and am having problems finding info online....please help with suggestions of meanings and possible survival time...thanks in advance",
    "bestanswer": "first of all i am a nurse and do private duty nursing and stayed with many cancer pts and seen how quickly that it affects the patients and their family. But no one really understands it til it affects a member of their own family. I have to agree with someone else that answered that hospice is the best and i know this first hand as on oct 2nd this year my dad found out he had lung cancer. a week later after a week of xrays and cat scans he found out the cancer had spread from his lungs to his throat and brain. with the throat cancer, he had lumps come up on his neck. for the last 5 yrs we thought dad was going thru alzheimers, but come to find out that some of the symptoms of brain cancer was forgetfulness and repeating themselves.i did alot of research on these 3 cancers, and it will tell you that lung cancer has no cure. all kemo and radiation does is try to shrink the cancer cells, but doesnt get rid of them completely.since your dad is refusing his meds, its possible that the kemo might have burned his throat like dad, dad couldnt take pills towards the end and had difficulty in swallowing. there is a product on the market that the dr can write a prescription for and also get it at walmart....its called thick it. just put a couple of teaspoons in his water or tea or soup and it will thicken it up enough where he can drink it with ease.from the time dad found out he had cancer til the time he died, he lived 52 days. like i said i know what you are going through as i have been there and experienced it first hand. dad died on thanksgiving day this year, its hard for me to talk about this sometimes, but, just maybe from what we went thru with dad will help someone else with lung, throat or brain cancer. i know for a fact that hospice will not come in until they are done with kemo or radiation.once they come in, they will get anything you need for him, such as hoist lift, hosp bed, bedside commode, shower seat, wheelchair and walker. they will be there any time you need them or just to talk. hospice is wonderful.we tried to get dads dr to put him on the morphine liquid drops and he refused and i am still furious about that. thanksgiving being a holiday, a hospice RN can override a drs orders which is what we did. we finally got him on the drops about 5 hrs before he died. hospice said it eased the transition from being in pain to leaving this world. all 3 kids were by his side when he left us. we told him we loved him and that we always had and that it was ok to go, that we would see him again.all that day he was unresponsive except for one time when he opened his eyes and looked at mom and said i love you babe. the sunday before he passed, we kids knew even as sick as he was, he still knew the love for mom and i had the pleasure of witnessing it first hand. he pulled her down and whispered in her ear and she smiled and said i love you too and then he pulled her down a second time and whispered something again, and again she smiled as tears came to her eyes as she said i have always loved you too. so my friend i hope that what i have shared with you has helped you in some ways. feel free to email me anytime you need to talk. sultrybitchnc@yahoo.com",

The Avinza is ok, but seems to be not as strong as the Oxy was in taking the pain away but with out the side affect. I am not sure what direction to head at this point, should I go back to the Oxy at a higher dose and deal with the side affect go with the Avinza at a higher dose, or is there some kind of supplement to either or both.

I also have a PRN oxycodone 5 mg. that I take for breakthrough pain.  If I remember right I was taking the Avenza every 12 hours when I took it.  Talk to your doctor maybe he can prescribe Oxy at a low dose for breakthrough pain.  That way you could keep taking the Avenza and a small dosage of oxy 1 to 2 times a day.  That low a dose shouldn't cause severe constipation.  Hope this helps.",

My periodontist thinks I might be clenching at night just simply based on my personality. She wants me to get a mouth guard that you put on only the top teeth at night. There's a chance I could be clenching, but I'm not sure. I know I did wake up with my teeth together real tight but that was only one night this week. I don't have periodontal disease.

I'd also suggest brushing with a regular soft brush because an electric brush can irritate the gums more.",
      "The mouth guard could keep you from causing any more damage to your teeth from your grinding.  They say 90 percent of the population clench and grind there teeth sometime during the day.  It would definitely be worth a try, the bruxism (grinding) can cause some recession",

    "bestanswer": "Get your breast enhancement  surgery in India.Cosmetic Surgery (including facelift/ breast enhancement tummy tuck./lipo) is very cheap in India.There is one company that is very famous in India that arranges cosmetic surgery for foreigners in India.They are called the Forerunners Healthcare.I read a lot about them in the Newspapers and about their patient stories.I have also read that they arrange financing for international patients as cosmetic surgery is not covered by insurance or by the stinking NHS.\n\nThey also have photos pasted of their International patients.You can checkout their website.The cost savings are incredible.As a doctor i personally believe that your surgery can be easily handled in India as the quality of healthcare available here is simply best in the world.The surgeons are USA/UK trained and facilities are 5 star .\n\nMy cousin got her cosmetic surgery done there and she is more than very happy with the results.sHe is all praise for this forerunners healthcare company.She paid just 30% of the cost what she was quoted in USA and it was like a wonderful vacation for her. .hope this helps.I think she paid only 8000$ for the tummy tuck and liposuction surgery for which she was quoted 22000 $ in USA.\n\nhttp://www.forerunnershealthcare.com",

    "content": "I have been to doctor after doctor to help me get sleep. I have major insomnia and it's killing me. I have been on all of the following meds, but still no quality sleep. Can anyone help.\n\nAmbien\nAmbien CR\nLunesta\nXanax\nRemeron\nTrazadone\nTempzapam\nValerion root \npassion flower.\n\nI have a 2 month old baby and sure would like to enjoy his life. I'll try anything.",
    "bestanswer": "I had a bad problem with insomnia for many years, and did some research on it.  Here are the things I\u2019ve found that help the most.\n\n1.  Don't take the sleeping pills.  Although they are not addictive in the way we tend to think (you won't jones for them if you miss taking them) they are addictive in the sense that once you have taken them for a while, you will have to take them to get to sleep, but they won't have the same effect they used too.   This is because you tend to not get the necessary REM sleep you need to be rested.  If you must take a sleeping pill, take it well before you go to sleep.  For instance, I prefer to take sleeping pills 2 hours before I go to sleep, so that the pill can get into my system and make me drowsy before I get into bed, then get out of my system (hopefully) early enough that I get some normal sleep.\n\n2.  Try to go to bed at about the same time every night.  You have some wiggle room on this, but if you stay out on Saturday night till 3, it'll be harder to go to sleep at 10PM Sunday.\n\n(Which somewhat contradicts:)\n\n3.  If possible, don't go to bed if you're not sleepy.  Note  - one thing I have read and found to be true is that you have to be awake for 12 hours before you can go back to sleep.  So if you sleep till noon, again, you won't be sleepy at 10PM.  \n\n4.  Don't spend more than 15-30 minutes trying to get to sleep.  If you notice that you've been in bed more than 15 minutes, get out of bed and do something for a while.  Make sure what you do isn't going to make you more hyper; e.g. no exercising or energetic music or writing posts to online debates. \n\n5.  When you go to bed, choose a chore or some other task that you do not want to do and tell yourself that if you are still awake in thirty minutes you will do that task.  Then, if you are still awake, get up and do your chosen task.  This is my favorite suggestion, as it has worked nearly every time I've used it. .\n\nThose are the most useful suggestions I have.  Other things you can try:\n\nBefore you start getting ready for sleep, turn off high energy music and turn the lights down.  I love R&R music, but I went through a period where I had to turn the radio off every night about an hour before I went to bed, or I would be too wired to sleep. And our bodies react to reduced light by producing melatonin which puts us to sleep.  \n\nGet plenty of exercise, but not right before bed.  (Unless you're weird like me - exercise right before bed just puts me to sleep)\n\nAnother suggestion that might work is to relax your body, consciously, one area at a time, starting from your feet. You think about the ball of your left foot and relax it, then the ball of your right foot, then the arch of your left foot, etc. You have to concentrate (pretty hard) on what you are doing\n\nSex *grin*  by yourself or with an SO, it produces a nice soporific chemical, which does a nice job of putting you to sleep.",

You might be sensitive to caffiene.\n    Meditation.\n    Try moving your bed around so your head faces in different directions.\n    If you knock yourself out with too many supplements,maybe you won't hear your baby when it needs you.\n    Melatonin is really good with no side effects. Adjust your dosage to find what is right for you.Experiment.Get the timed release pills.\n    Stick with Natural ingredients though. Many sleep formulas use already tried herbal remedies,so they are only ripping you off.\n   Chamomile tea (at any health food store) Use two or three bags.

Everything he came into contact w/ worsened the rash & pain! This was my first child, to say I was in a panic was an understatement! The dermatologist said \"Contact Dermatitis or Eczema\". He was allergic to EVERYTHING w/ scent!! Wow! I was using Baby Magic Bath, Baby Magic Lotion, Dreft detergent, Downy fabric softener, scented baby powder, scented baby wipes, ALL the stuff that smells sooo baby good! As soon as I stopped using the scented products & started using unscented everything the rash & itching stopped. It was a matter of 2 to 3 days.

My wife says it will go away but im not sure since I would expected it to go away already if it wasnt serious.Should we go to the doctors just in case?",

She can bend and extend her arm but cannot lift it?  If you're describing this the way I'm hearing it, the problem could be at her shoulder.  Get her to a doctor anyway, she's worth it.

I took it for a month and lost about 13 (but I didn't exercise).\n\nI bought the natural hoodia from this website: http://www.alllsite.info/free-diet-pills.php . I checked the web site address so I can post it here and I saw they're running a promotion now to get a free 2 week sample for only $4.97!

    "content": null,
    "bestanswer": "Uterine fibroids are benign tumors of muscle and connective tissue that develop within, or are attached to, the uterine wall.  \n\nSymptoms:\nSensation of fullness or pressure in lower abdomen \nPelvic cramping or pain with periods \nAbdominal fullness, gas \nIncrease in urinary frequency \nHeavy menstrual bleeding (menorrhagia), sometimes with the passage of blood clots \nSudden, severe pain due to a pedunculated fibroid \n\nNote: There are often no symptoms.\n\nMethods of treatment depend on the severity of symptoms, the patient's age, her pregnancy status, her possible desire for future pregnancies, her general health, and characteristics of the fibroids. Treatment may consist of simply monitoring the rate of growth of the fibroids with periodic pelvic exams or ultrasound.\n\nNonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications like ibuprofen or naprosyn may be recommended for lower abdominal cramping or pain with menses. Iron supplementation will help to prevent anemia in women with heavy periods. These methods are usually sufficient in premenopausal women.\n\nHormonal treatment, involving drugs such as injectable Depo Leuprolide, causes fibroids to shrink, but can also cause significant side effects. This method is sometimes used for short treatment periods before surgical procedures or when menopause is imminent.\n\nThe hormones produce an environment in the body that is very similar to that of menopause, with associated side effects like hot flashes, vaginal dryness, and loss of bone density.\n\nThe treatment lasts several months and during this time the reduction in estrogen concentration allows the fibroids to shrink. Fibroids will begin to enlarge as soon as treatment stops.\n\nHysteroscopic resection of fibroids (an outpatient surgical procedure) may be appropriate for women with fibroids growing within the uterine cavity. In this procedure, a small camera and instruments are inserted through the cervix into the uterus to remove the fibroid tumors.\n\nUterine artery embolization is a new procedure aimed at preventing the need for major surgery. Small catheters are placed through veins in the pelvis and advanced to the arteries that supply the uterus with blood.\n\nMaterials are then injected to block these arteries permanently. The decreased blood supply to the uterus may prevent further growth of the fibroids and may cause them to shrink. The long-term effects of this procedure are still unknown, and the safety of pregnancy after this procedure is questionable.\n\nA myomectomy, which is a surgical procedure to remove just the fibroids, is frequently the chosen treatment for premenopausal women who want to bear more children, because it usually can preserve fertility.\n\nAnother advantage of a myomectomy is that it controls pain or excessive bleeding that some women with uterine fibroids experience. However, a myomectomy often cannot remove very small fibroids that may grow and cause symptoms in the future.\n\nA total hysterectomy, which involves removal of the uterus, is a curative option that is often chosen by older women.",

    "subject": "What does it mean if I was told I have level one mild dysplasia? Is it really cancer?",
    "content": "How much time after being diagnosed do I have before I have full blown cancer.",
    "bestanswer": "Cervical dysplasia is a term used to describe the appearance of abnormal cells on the surface of the cervix, the lowest part of the uterus. These changes in cervical tissue are classified as mild, moderate, or severe. While dysplasia itself does not cause health problems, it is considered to be a precancerous condition. Left untreated, dysplasia sometimes progresses to an early form of cancer known as cervical carcinoma in situ, and eventually to invasive cervical cancer. \n\nIt can take 10 years or longer for cervical dysplasia to develop into cancer. Dysplasia can be detected from a Pap smear, the single most important step that a woman can take to prevent cervical cancer. \n\nMild dysplasia is the most common form, and up to 70% of these cases regress on their own (i.e., the cervical tissue returns to normal without treatment). Moderate and severe dysplasia are less likely to self-resolve and have a higher rate of progression to cancer. The greater the abnormality, the higher the risk for developing cervical cancer. \n\nDetecting and treating dysplasia early is essential to prevent cancer. For this reason, most physicians quickly remove suspicious cervical lesions and require frequent Pap smears to monitor for recurrences. \n\nIncidence and Prevalence \nEvery year, between 250,000 and 1 million women in the United States are diagnosed with cervical dysplasia. While it can occur at any age, the peak incidence is in women between the ages of 25 to 35. Most dysplasia cases can be cured with proper treatment and follow-up. Without treatment, 30% to 50% may progress to invasive cancer. \n\nRisk Factors \n\nRisk factors increase the frequency of occurrence. Several risk factors have been linked to dysplasia including multiple sexual partners, early onset of sexual activity, cigarette smoking, and sexually transmitted diseases, especially human papillomavirus (HPV) and HIV infection. \n\nHPV Infection \nEighty to ninety percent of women with cervical dysplasia have an HPV infection. Human papillomavirus (HPV) is a group of more than 80 different viral strains. About one-third are sexually transmitted, and some types cause genital warts. HPV infects about 25 million people in the United States, and most of the viral strains are harmless. \nHowever, the NIH Consensus Conference on Cancer of the Cervix and the World Health Organization (WHO) have concluded that several strains of HPV cause cervical cancer. The strains found most frequently in precancerous lesions and in cervical cancer are types 16 and 18. Other strains with high malignant potential include 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 56, 58, and 68, and together, they account for almost 90% of cancerous lesions and dysplasia in HPV infections. \n\nMost HPV infections resolve within 6 months and many women develop immunity. HPV often does not cause symptoms. One study found that nearly one-half of the women infected with HPV had no symptoms and a person may not even know that they are infected. Untreated HPV can result in recurrent and persistent cervical dysplasia and many experts believe that HPV is the main cause for changes in cervical cells that result in dysplasia. \n\n\nHIV Infection \nWomen who are infected with HIV are at a greater risk for developing dysplasia. The risk appears to increase as the number of CD4 cells (cells that play a critical role in immune responses) decreases. HIV-positive women also have a higher rate of persistent HPV infections and may be infected with the strains that are associated with severe dysplasia and cervical cancer. Women whose immune systems are suppressed for other reasons, such as by drugs that prevent rejection of organ transplants, are also at greater risk. This suggests that women with weakened immunity are more likely to be infected with HPV and to have a persistent infection that does not resolve on its own. \n\nSmoking \nNicotine and cotinine, chemicals produced from tobacco, have been found in the cervical cells of women who smoke.",

      "My doctor told me that CIN 1 dysplasia only becomes cancerous about 10% of the time (if it progresses to CIN 2, that figure goes up to about 45%.)  I don't know for sure how accurate those figures are, but I asked him point blank and that's what he told me.\n\nMany, many cases of mild dysplasia will resolve on their own as your immune system responds to the abnormality.  You can, at this stage, keep monitoring it with frequent Pap smears.  Or you can opt for cryotherapy or LEEP procedures, both of which excise a portion of the cervix to remove the abnormal area.\n\nMild dysplasia is scary, but it is not a diagnosis of cancer!  Nor is it a one-way ticket to cancer in the future.  Talk to your doctor about your concerns; he or she will tell your their opinion on whether/how it should be treated and will let you know how often they want to check for changes.",

    "content": "My breasts are causing me to have such great pain...in my upper back, neck and shoulders. I went in to have a consult but I got a denial letter from the insurance company saying that I didn't qualify (That was spring 05).  I am currently in Physical Therapy but it doesn't seem to be helping.  In fact it seems to have made it worse...even though all they've done is massage.  I'm wondering if it is because of the muscles being relaxed after so long of not that I can really feel the pain now when they tense up.\n\nAny help would be appreciated.\n\n~~Theresa",
    "bestanswer": "go to ur doctor, tell them u are interested in getting a breast reduction, they will measure ur breast in, from ur shoulders to the tip of ur nipple, and then around ur top (where the bras goes around), they will recommend a Plastic Surgeon (this is a referral, so it shouldnt cost u a thing, but every place is different) .. the surgeon will do the same thing,and take a picture of ur breast (no face) for ur insurance comapany,  and tell u whether or not u qualify for one, (altho he isnt the sole decider in this case, and if he tells u that u dont, tell him what is wrong, ( u might not need a reduction, just a lift) saggy breast and can be just as painful as big breast, and when the 2 are mixed, its more painful!!!!  then he will ask for ur insurance info, and then fax over ur picture and measurments, insurance companied like to procrastonate, u just need to keep calling and askign them whats up with the aproval, they will probably give u the run around, they did with me but i took no BS from them! my insuracne was running out in 2 weeks so i had to be on themn like flies on dead meat! LOL! when/if the insurance company does approve the request the surgeon will send u a letter or call you, with the date of the surgery..... \n\nalso  most insurance copanies, have qualifications requirements to a reduction as it cost alot of money! my insurance company  required i had to have ATLEAST 12 oz removed, nothing less in each breast ( i more than qualified) i had 6lbs removed!!! (WHEW) ... u can find out what ur Insurance requirements are, u can either call them or find out online,  go to the insuracne companies website and look around....\n\n\nDo u have indents ur shoulders from the weight of ur breast tuggin on the bra starp? cuz that will be and instant aproval, or so i was told!\n\n\ngood luck",

    "bestanswer": "I hope it was a reputable orthopedic surgeon who did your arthroscopy. You should tell him and/or his nurse that you have questions about this. You can make an appt, even if just for this. \n\nAn ACL repair is a lengthy operation, but in my experience necessary if you've torn your ACL, anterior cruciate ligament.\n\nThe small holes are where they put in the long narrow camera to see what's going on inside you knee area. Once you are under ansethesia, they will fill your knee with fluid and look in there.\n\n If you have a torn meniscus, cartilage, the Dr can see it trapped, or pieces floating that he can grab and take out thru another hole where he puts in a grabber, a long narrow tool with a tweezer like end. A third hole may be necessary also.\nSometimes this is all someone needs to fix the problem.\n\nIf the ligament is torn and needs repair, they go ahead and do it while you are asleep then. \nIf so, they would've talked to you about this prior to your arthroscopy. (fancy word for 'arthro' is joint, 'oscopy' using a scope).\n\nI've assisted on many of these in surgery, but  haven't witnessed the recovery. I believe it is a long one. This is what you hear many athletes having done.\n\nHope it helps! Talk to your surgeon, whether he rushes you or not. He works for you!",

    "content": null,
    "bestanswer": "These may be caused by 2 things:\n\n1. Gastro-esophageal reflux disease or GERD: It is the reflux of the acid from the stomach into the esophagus, producing heartburn. Lifestyle modifications like eating smaller meals (u may eat more often), eating meals at regular time, eating dinner atleast 3 hours before bedtime, elevating the head end of the bed, avoiding food that exacerbate these symptoms, etc. help. You may also try over the counter antacids or home remedies like milk for the occasional heartburn, but these are in no way curative. Your doc may also prescribe some drugs like ranitidine/famotidine or omeprazole/lansoprazole to decrease the acid production, but these will only bring temporary symptomatic relief. If symptoms persist, eventually, surgery may be necessary. Also, if you have had this problem for a long time, it would be best to consult a doc, since chronic reflux of acid into the esophagus can result in serious problems like a Barrett's esophagitis, which may, very rarely, develop into a malignancy. It would therefore be best to discuss these issues with your doc.\n\n2. Peptic Ulcer Disease: Either a gastric(stomach) or a duodenal ulcer may produce stomach pain and heartburn. The cause is a bacterium called Helicobacter pylori. It can be treated with a combination of 2 antibiotics and omeprazole/lansoprazole. Again, it would be best to Ask your doc, and see whether you indeed have H.pylori infection and get it treated. Symptomatic relief may be obtained with over the counter antacids, but it will only be temporary. Complete eradication of the H.pylori infection will result in resolution of these symptoms.",
    "nbestanswers": [
      "There are many potential causes of heart burn and stomach pain.  An excellent book is available that can teach you about the causes and proper treatment of these types of problems (without using symptom masking and dangerous drugs).  It is called \"No More Heartburn\".  The book is written by Sherry Rogers, M.D. and is available at Amazon.com or from the publisher at 1-800-846-6687.  I highly recommend this book.\n\nBest wishes.",
      "It's pretty simple (or at least it's what I did).  You need to stop eating the foods that cause it.",
      "I read this on the internet   drink some apple cider vinegar in a glass of water.  I have GERD but I haven't got the nerve up to try yet as it  tastes terrible.",
      "to start with watch what you eat. watch out for things like high acid foods(tomatoes,oranges) also caffiene. And obviousley spicy foods. You may find that its one paticular food that you intake everyday that can cause it. Im a coffee drinker and coffee gives me heartburn BUT it depends on how strong the coffee is and how old or fresh it is. i am not so willing to give it up. But i limit my intake. A good habit when you know your going to be eating something that may cause heartburn is try to take a Maalox BEFORE you eat this will coat your stomach. If this goes on for a long time go see a Dr. it could be acid reflux which can cause ulcerations in your assophogus if not treated."

The other treatments I have seen as a RN of 23 years is steroid creams, or pills, but that isn't a long term solution. Your doctor will probably send you to an Allergist, and if they can find out what you are allergic to, or the cause, then the treatment would be more specific. In the meantime, you can try the over the counter creams that have cortisone in them, or the ones that combine Benadryl with Calamine lotion, or try some of the products that have oatmeal in them. That will at least sooth you until you can get a more definitive treatment. Good luck."

      "HIV is spread most commonly by having unprotected sex with an infected partner. The virus can enter the body through the lining of the vagina, vulva, penis, rectum, or mouth during sex. Because early HIV infection often causes no symptoms, your health care provider usually can diagnose it by testing your blood for the presence of antibodies (disease-fighting proteins) to HIV. HIV antibodies generally do not reach noticeable levels in the blood for 1 to 3 months following infection. It may take the antibodies as long as 6 months to be produced in quantities large enough to show up in standard blood tests. Hence, to determine whether you have been recently infected (acute infection), your health care provider can screen you for the presence of HIV genetic material. Direct screening of HIV is extremely critical in order to prevent transmission of HIV from recently infected individuals. If you have been exposed to the virus, you should get an HIV test as soon as you are likely to develop antibodies to the virus-within 6 weeks to 12 months after possible exposure to the virus.",

    "subject": "Does anyone have degenerative disk disease?  How do you cope?",
    "content": null,
    "bestanswer": "degenerative disc disease is caused by wear and tear in the disc and can be treated in he most cases by\nPain medication. Typical pain medications used to treat the low back pain include acetaminophen, NSAIDs, oral steroids, narcotic drugs, and muscle relaxants. Each type of medication has strengths, limitations, and risks, and the patient\u2019s particular low back problem and overall health will determine which pain reliever, if any, is indicated. \n\nChiropractic manipulation. Manual manipulation by a chiropractor or other qualified health professional is thought to  help relieve low back pain by taking pressure off sensitive neurological tissue, increasing range of motion, restoring blood flow, reducing muscle tension, and creating a series of chemical reactions in the body (such as endorphin release) that act as natural painkillers. \n\nEpidural injections. An epidural injection into the spine delivers steroids that can provide low back pain relief by decreasing inflammation in the painful area. \n\nTENS units. These devices deliver mild electrical stimulation that overrides the painful signals sent to the lower back. \n\nUltrasound. For acute low back pain, ultrasound may be used to warm the area, which in turn brings blood flow and healing nutrients to the area. \n\nMassage. Therapeutic low back massage is thought to provide low back pain relief by improving blood flow, reducing muscle stiffness, increasing range of motion, and raising endorphin levels in the body. \n\nIn addition, heat and/or ice therapy, acupuncture, behavioral therapy, and other therapies often provide enough low back pain relief to allow the patient to progress with his or her exercise and rehabilitation program.\n\nActive treatments for low back pain may include: \n\nExercise. For the vast majority of patients, the only way to achieve long-term healing is active exercise, which usually includes a combination of strengthening, stretching, and low-impact aerobic exercise. \n\nQuitting smoking. For patients who smoke, doctors recommend quitting smoking to improve blood circulation and healing. Chronic tobacco use is closely linked to chronic low back pain.\n\nWeight loss can reduce low back pain in overweight people by lessening the amount of stress on the low back\u2019s muscles and ligaments.\n\nErgonomics. Proper lifting techniques, ergonomic furniture, supportive footwear, and avoiding static posture for prolonged periods of time can help take pressure off the low back.",

I'm losing weight and not even trying.\" Then they'll do tests to see what disease process could be causing this.

    "bestanswer": "Being type I, I have only read up on that field. Recent advancements include - \n\n1. Closed loop insulin pumps\nThe technology for real-time continuous glucose monitors and programmable insulin pumps already exists, however no-one has managed to get them to talk to each other yet. Research has been done into the ideal polymers to make all-in-one models, but as far as I know, no actual closed loop pumps exist within the research community. Part of the problem is that the real time meters still need to be calibrated independently with separate blood sugar monitoring up to four times a day, which makes them almost redundant.\n\n2. Islet cell implantation\nDonated cells are never going to be the answer, as there's not enough to go round. Currently, anti-rejection drugs are problematic as they suppress the body's natural defences and increase the risk of cancers etc. Stem cell research may resolve this - cells which differentiate very early on in development and preferably from your own body shouldn't be rejected, hence no need for drugs to suppress your immune system. However, research is being suppressed by the American government - presumably the pro-life lobbyists are an important part of the electorate.\n\nOne or the other should be developed and through phase III trials in the next ten years, but you need to keep working on your blood sugar until then. Most of the vaccines are, by definition, aimed at preventing diabeted developing (including type I) rather than curing it. As an aside, a drug called ruboxistaurin was submitted to the FDA last year, which blocks a subset of a protein called PKC, thought to be the mediator of vascular damage caused by prolonged hyperglycaemia. Studies have shown some improvement in retinopathy and nephropathy - however, the study has shown no effect on neuropathy. Ely-Lilly, the pharmaceutical company, have gone a little on the quiet side about it since August last year, but they were hoping to have it approved and launched in the near future.",

If what I just stated was not true then God would have design a girl to menstruate from birth. Many women do not have a period and in yoga one is taught as soon as a girl starts is when she begins to age. Also it is a natural birth control method that is why some women do not have a period. There are yoga excersise to prevent menstruation. The children coming into the planet today or not the same as yesteryear!

To the rest of us, it is probably no more than a normal woman's belly. \n\nIf you are really upset about this, why don't you go to a reputable plastic surgeon and have liposuction done? And if it's not a fat deposit that is responsible for this, he can tell you that too.\n\nBefore you think that I don't know what I'm talking about...I was anorexic and bulimic myself.

This is because as you grow, the heart murmur stays the same size, and thus becomes less significant compared to the size of your heart.  A heart murmur is caused by one of your valves between your chambers of your heart not closing all the way and a little blood squeezing backward into the previous chamber when your heart compresses (beats).

In yrs. gone by it killed many & it killed them fast. I suppose the drugs they could use are better today, but yrs back they had little to fight it with.

    "bestanswer": "I love questions like this.  There are hundreds of books out there that say something like \"death begins in the colon\" and \"cleanse the toxins\" and other rubbish.\n\nWhile there is truth to poor diets causing ill health (Americans eat a lot of fat and have a very high incidence of colon cancer), there's a lot of myths too.\n\nFiber is the key.  Instead of looking for miracle cures, adapt a healthy lifestyle.  Eat whole-fiber, low fat foods and read labels.  (While you're at it, cut down on the salt too).  Just reaching the FDA's recommended allowance of fiber daily can be a challenge.  (No more fast food!)  Also, drink plenty of water.  You can't flush out the bad if it's stuck like a rock inside of you.  (Constipation hurts).  Finally, exercise.  Along with all the other health benefits (and burning calories, duh) regular exercise will promote peristalsis (the regular movement of stuff through your insides).  \n\nSeriously though, it takes some work to keep yourself healthy.  Keep at it.  And please stay away from people who are going to shove stuff where it doesn't belong and \"flush you out\".  That's really not good for you.  Also, stay away from laxatives unless your doctor suggests it.  They can have very bad side effects.  \n\nJust eat right and exercise.\n\nFootnote:  Enemas and Go-Lytly are not good!  You can severely imbalance your sodium and postassium levels!  (read: heart failure)  Don't stick things up there unless a doctor (a real doctor) tells you to!",

Obviously, it\u2019s rarely the goal of any workout to take you to a point of all-out exhaustion, but using percentages of a Max HR to determine the appropriate intensity for a given workout (or series of workouts) can help create more efficient and effective fitness routines. For example, working out at half the Max HR is great for improving health and increasing base level of fitness, while working out at 75 percent of Max HR is a great way to improve cardiovascular capacity and endurance.\n\nBut the best method for determining Max HR remains a hotly debated topic. The main problem is that Max HR is not influenced so much by age as by genetics. In fact, most people of similar age do not have the exact same Max HR.\n\nThere are basically three methods. Two of them require professional training equipment or resources. The following formula is the most reliable for do-it-yourselfers: Calculate 210 minus one-half your age; minus 5 percent of your body weight (in pounds); plus four (for men) or zero (for women). This formula has been tested on thousands of people and the results typically fall within five heartbeats of a person\u2019s true Max HR. Of course, even this formula leaves something to be desired, but it beats the simple \u201c220 minus age\u201d hands down. To calculate your target heart zone, multiply the Max HR number by 65% and then by 85%. That represents the target heart range.",

Target heart rates are based off your maximum heart rate, which you cannot determine with any accuracy without have a stress test performed by a qualified facility.\n\nYour maximum heart rate is highly individualized, and will vary from person to person.  It does not change with age, it has nothing to do with your level of fitness, and it will vary depending on the activity you perform (it's activity-specific).\n\nOne generic way of calculating your maximum heart rate is subtracting your age from 220.  This is almost never accurate (unless by chance) and gives the impression that older individuals have lower maximum heart rates, which is not true.\n\nIt is, however, a VERY conservative estimate, and ensures that you do not exceed a safe level of intensity if you are just beginning a cardio routine.  Shoot for 65-75% of this number for starters.  More often than not, it will be very easy and you will have to challenge yourself a bit more to make progress.  \n\nAlso, unless you are using an EKG accurate, chest-strap heart rate monitor, you will have no idea what heart rate you are actually working at (as you cannot go by how you \"feel\").",

    "content": "What is it? How do you get it? How do you reduce thet chances of getting it? Do condoms help? Is it possible for a woman who has only had sex with one man, & that same man who has only had sex with her, to get it?",
    "bestanswer": "Hello:\nThis is in response to your question posted on yahoo concerning HPV. HPV stands for \"human papilloma virus\". There are several strains of this particular virus. It is responsible for common warts on the hands, fingers, plantar warts. It is also responsible for abnormal pap smears. There are about 4-6 strains of HPV that can actually cause cervical cancer. If my memory serves me correctly, they are strains #6, 11, 18 and 36. It is also responsible for genital warts and anal warts. These are sexually transmitted and yes, condoms can reduce the risk of contracting HPV.  If a woman and a man have never had sex with anyone else, then there is no way either can be infected with the genital type of HPV, especially the pre-cancerous strains. Women usually find out they have HPV on the cervix when they go for their annual pap smear. Unfortunately, men often do not know they have it. A lot of times in men, the HPV warts are up inside their urethra and in the absence of pain, pain on urination or blood in the urine, they go undected. This is why HPV is such a problem and is probably the most common sexually transmitted disease in the United States running a close race with chlamydia infection. Merck, a pharmaceutical company has just come out with a vaccine against the dangerous strains of HPV to give to virgin teenagers and older women who have never had sex. This vaccine virtually guarantees that the person will not get infected with the four strains of HPV responsible for 100 percent of cases of cervical cancer.  This is the first vaccine that can prevent a sexually transmitted disease!!! \nOther than having protected sex with a condom, there really is not any other thing you can do to protect yourself against being infected with the pre-cancerous causing strains.  Once you have the HPV virus, it stays in your body forever, just like the herpes virus.\nI hope this was helpful in answering your questions and alleviating some of your concerns about HPV.\nRegards,\nWarren Shaffer, M.D.",

At that time, I was also told that I had cysts on my ovaries and uterus. \n\nBesides the complications that come along with having endometriosis, I've been okay. Last night, I felt like my ovaries were going to explode. My muscles became really tense, I got really dizzy, then I felt like I was going to get sick. \n\nI'm feelng a bit better today, and believe it or not, I'm on my period and I'm still able to function. I haven't been able to do that in years. Trust me - I'm grateful that I'm not in excrutiating pain (Just yet) but I'm also sorta worried about what I seen last night - clear mucus. I know it sounds nasty, hence my concern. It was there when I wiped. No other time.\n\n My sides are sore today...but like I said, I'm feeling UNUSUALLY well for being on my period. Has this ever happened to you? What was it? I don't want to hear 'go to a doc.'\n\nExplain in detail. Thanks.",
    "bestanswer": "Thick clear vaginal discharge is normal, and there is nothing you should be worried. It is important that CLEAR SLIMY DISCHARGE DURING MENSTRUAL CYCLE will not interfere with a pap smear, or Testing for Urethritis. I want you to understand that is normal for secretion from the vagina to change from slimy fluid to one that is whitish or yellow. The smell may be very mild or quite noticeable, depends from period of your menstrual cycle. The amount of this secretion depends also much upon the menstrual cycle. Sexual arousal and nervous stress are factors that could change this normal vaginal discharge. Secretion first appears in girls around puberty and last throughout the woman\u2019s life. The aim of this secretion produced by the cervical glands is to keep the genitalia clean. It also helps sperm stay alive for up to seven days after the intercourse. Vaginal discharges are secretions present in the vagina, and I hope you know not it may be clear, white, yellow or greenish in color. A vaginal discharge that is excessive in amount, yellow or green in color, or has foul smelling, is considered abnormal and require doctors check up. \n\nYou may also find this helpful: (it sounds wierd to most, but it may help figure your mystery without an MD for the time)\nYou can check her mucus in several ways, depending on which is most comfortable for you. Some of the options are:\n\n\n1-wipe the vaginal opening with toilet tissue before urination \nobserve the discharge on underpants \n2-obtain some of the mucus by placing your fingers (making sure they are clean) in the vagina.\n3-When checking the mucus, be sure to note the color. It may be white, creamy, opaque, or clear. \n\nEarly mucus is usually described by one of these terms: Scanty, not a lot present, the consistency is thick and sticky, it usually holds it shape. The color is white or opaque.\n\nNext there is \"Transitional stage\". Some of the characteristics of this stage are: Increasing amounts of mucus, mucus will be thinner, and cloudy in appearance and color. At this stage, it is slightly stretchy.\n\nThe final stage before ovulation is the \"Highly fertile stage\". At this time, mucus will usually be visible in profuse amounts. It's thin, and transparent. It's often called \"egg white cervical mucus\" because of its stretchy properties.\n\n\nGood luck",

I have noticed that the week before I get my period the pain is HORRIBLE but the week it finally comes I am okay, and then the week after it is over I still have what I call after cramps. \nI do feel for you.

It is common and doctor's actually hope that they do that on their own...that's why they wait before they give laporoscopies! That is the cause for you feeling a little better and the mucus. Depending on your age...I would suggest you talk to an ob/gyn about getting a hysterectomy. Endometriosis does not get better and it is very painful.

    "content": "my 7 month old daughter has been suffering for the past 4 months, her whole body is covered in clusters of small red bumps and she is itchy all over. the doctors said she has eczema.  ive tried everything to help it and nothing is working, im starting to think maybe its an allergy to something.  i know that most people would just listen to the doctor but these are army doctors and some dont seem too bright, ive had a lot of trouble with them and dont have much choice as to who i see or what hospital i go to.  any ideas on what else this could be?",
    "bestanswer": "Could well be that this is skin condition brought on by allergies. The allergen is either something she is exposed to externally or something she is getting from your breastmilk or from the infant formula your using. try changing formulas if your using them. If breastmilk, then you must start the process of elimination and see what makes a difference when you exclude it from your diet. A good indicator can be some thing you eat that unsettles her after feeding time. Possibly find out from a Naturopath what foods you are sensitive to and eliminate those from your diet also as they can pass through as well. Try changing the covers and clothes you use to natural fabrics as well.\nAntihistamines are not great for infants and are a last resort. Try some Calendular Ointment, this will sooth the rash as will bathing with Chamomile Tea. See this website http://www.carolineskincare.com.au this is a wonderful natural product that can help as well, I have used it a lot in my clinic and on my own kids. These are only topical (external)treatments, the underlying allergen (cause) needs to be found and gotten rid of so please do not think that it has cleared when the rash dies down a bit.\nIt is also possible she has Psoriasis which is also aggravated by allergies and heat. \n\nIf you would like further help then go here http://www.jentleearthhealing.com/medherb.html and enter in your question in as much detail as possible and I will do my best.\n\nCraig - Naturoapth",

This time my oldest son was a teenager and when he was told to apply and then shower he didn't put it on his genitals and guess what!?  Yup, we all got them again.\nThey definately like to live in warm, dark and moist spaces, but if not treated right away they will spread and they do this by burrowing under the skin.; As disgusting as it is scabies are a live mite that is living under the skin and they can travel. So the most common places are the finger webs, under breasts, elbow crease, groin and so on, and the most common formation is kind of lines of bumps that are formed as they burrow along.\nBy the way, yes you need to wash all the linens and the clothes they wore but you do not need to treat the whole house with the sprays and stuff. These things are for lice not for scabies.  Hope this helps",

      "This is what my Dr said  *They appear in a trail.  He concluded that my bumps were not that. I still get those bumps  they are on my shoulder/back area.  Several years ago  the Dr and I called them chicken pox ,but really I still do not know what it is.  I don*t go again and again to Dr's as I have no insurance. It starts to look like anyones guess to me.  I would appreciate hearing what you learn. Hope the trail thing helps.",
      "You are correct when you say they like warm crevices. Around the waist is another common area. Scabies are transmitted by direct and close contact with someone that has scabies and intuitions are a common place to find them. Unless you have reason to believe you have had close contact with someone with scabies you might want to get a second opinion on that. Meantime, yes, the prescription cream works well.",
      "I had it before.  On my lower leg.  You can get it anywhere from anywhere. You simply touched something that someone else touched who had it.  I thought the same as you.  I'm clean, my house is clean  where did this come from?  It'll creep you out if you think about exactly what it is but it is very easy to get.  I had a itchy rash on my leg and actually my mom went to the doctor for something totally unrelated and mentioned that I had this.  Right away he said Oh she works with all those kids.  (I worked in a clinic) She's got scabies and he prescribed the Kwell (however you spell it) and yes it cleared it up within a few days.  It is VERY contagious ,which is how you and I contracted it, for the first I think 3 days.  You can even spread it to yourself.  So you must wash your hands often.  You touch it and touch somewhere else you could cause a spread.  If you touch something else (doorknobs, counters, etc.) it could spread to others.  Wash your bedding and give counter tops and doorknowbs a disenfectant wash.  Try not to scratch that will only irritate more.  There are also over the counter creams.  Just look at your local pharmacy or ask the pharmacist and they will direct you.  The prescription is stronger and works faster."

    "bestanswer": "Yes.  I had two at the same time in the lower back.  After weighing all the options I went with surgery.  I got two opinions and both were the same - physical therapy will not cure the problem.  When the disk is herniated it has compressed and the actual \"jelly\" is making contact with the spinal nerve.  The disk must be trimmed in order to relieve the pain.  \n\nI had the surgery in a spine clinic with an expert surgeon.  With my insurance I was out about $1500.00 out of over $25,000.00 worth of treatment.  I was walking within 8 hours of the surgery and doing physical therapy the next day.  Within 8 weeks I was back to work and within six months I was fully healed.  I have had no trouble since then.\n\nThe hardest part was forcing myself to do the therapy.  That is where healing and recovery really takes place.  It can be painful to walk the first few weeks, but you MUST DO IT!  Otherwise you will have complications.  Kicking the pain meds was hard, too, but I dropped them cold turkey and had only one bad day.\n\nMy advice would be to pick a surgeon with a good reputation for doing the procedure you need.  Secondly, make sure it is done in a facility with a low infection rate. You can research that on the net.  \n\nFinally, do the surgery.  Therapy is just prolonging the inevitable.",

When i drove home, i could only focus on the back trunk of the car in front of me, seemed like head couldn't turn. Took Tegretol right away (wean off by Dr.a week ago to try), the frozen thing was gone in 1/2 hour. Next day, same thing, freezed,. (couldn't look up, just blank stare and head dropped). Tegretol didn't work, went to emergency. Sent home after 6 hours lying on stretcher. Is it \"really\" seizure? If so, what kind? Or did I just have aura and no seizure? Will I black out eventually?

You can have it in the cracks between the fingers or on the face but it is almost always the formed in the natal crack, where guys in particular tend to be hairy and it can prevent you from being able to sit down, because it is so painful.   \n\nHopefully you have been referred to hospital.   An operation to remove the hair blockage is the only answer, followed by antibiotics.   Unfortunately no amount of pain killers will work.  The blockage needs clearing as well as the infection.  \n\nMy friends son had the natal crack operated on a couple of years ago - it was a great success and although they say that they do not guarantee it wont happen again because it is usually people with a lot of body hair that have it (which is why you are 4 times more likely to have it if you are male) it has not occurred with him and after the op he was so much better.\n\nGood luck\n\nFor a little bit more about Treatment:-\n\nhttp://www.surgical-tutor.org.uk/default-home.htm?system/abdomen/pilonidal_sinus.htm~right",

    "bestanswer": "from:\nhttp://ca.askmen.com/love/love_tip_200/232b_love_tip.html\nhttp://www.jackinworld.com/qa/qasem.html\n\nOf all the various aspects of the male human body, few are as variable from individual to individual as semen. The color, texture, and quantity \u2014 not to mention the force of ejaculation \u2014 vary greatly. Based on outward appearance we are all amazingly similar: virtually everyone has eyes, ears, a nose, and a mouth in the same place. But semen just doesn't work that way. \nJust like penis size, ejaculation volume and force are highly variable from individual to individual. Most guys want to ejaculate more semen with more force.\nIf you've done exercises like Kegels For Men, yes, it may have increased your distance \u2014 but probably not your volume. There's a *huge* variation from person to person with regard to ejaculation force as well as volume, and neither has anything to do with anything important (such as having children).\n\nA lot of guys would love it if they could make like one of the characters in Scary Movie and ejaculate so much that they plaster their girlfriends against the ceiling. And although that won't likely be happening anytime soon, it's believed that wheat germ increases seminal output. Bon app\u00e9tit.\n(Butter's note: I only tried it once and it thickened my load like I've rarely seen before. Eat with oatmeal for better results)\n\nAmino acids, if taken regularly, are generally believed to increase ejaculate fluid. On the other hand, zinc seems to improve both the amount of sperm produced as well as the sperm's ability to move spontaneously and independently. Together with amino acids, this will increase normal sperm count and volume significantly. \nAmino acids are believed to increase ejaculate fluid (not the amount of actual sperm necessarily) if taken regularly. Some amino acids include:\n\nL-ARGININE HCL\nStudies show sperm and semen volume doubles, fertility improves (even among men with low sperm counts or poor sperm motility), and sperm health and activity increase with supplementation. Arginine is found in high concentrations in nuts and seeds like peanuts and almonds. It can also be found in chocolate and raisins. Some Natural Sources: Nuts, sunflower seeds, sesame seeds, chocolate, popcorn, raisins, brown rice, carob, gelatin desserts, oatmeal, whole wheat bread, and protein rich foods. \n\nL-LYSINE\nResearchers find that this amino acids plus zinc increases sperm produced, stimulates testosterone production, and improves semen quality.\n\nEPIMEDIUM SAGITTATUM\nSometimes called \"horny goat weed,\" this botanical boosts libido and testosterone levels for greater sperm production for a strong ejaculation.\n\nZINC OXIDE\nHas been shown to increase number of sperm and sperm motility by 80% to 200% by aiding testosterone synthesis.\n\nL-CARNITINE\nThis amino acid is found in high concentrations in healthy sperm. Proven to significantly increase the percentage of highly motile sperm.\n\nCATUABA BARK\nBrazilian herb that strengthens the libido, and nourishes the entire male reproductive system.\n\nPUMPKIN SEED\nSupports prostate health and hormonal production. While they may not readily increase sperm volume, they do enhance prostate health and testosterone production.\n \nMACA\nLegendary South American botanical proven to promote libido, potency and energy.\n\nGinseng Y\nohimbe bark\nVitamin C, E\nMagnesium\n(Butter's note: Lecithin added daily increases amount, not thickness)\n\nZinc has been shown to improve both the amount of sperm you produce and the sperm's ability to move spontaneously and independently. Coupled with amino acids (see above), this will increase sperm volume significantly.\n(Butter's note: Not as miraculous as they make it sound, but regular zinc intake (50mgs a day) does increase quantity somewhat.)\n\nWhatever a pill company's claims are, you can probably do just as well with zinc and lecithin supplements.

    "subject": "Is Erectile Dysfunction a resultant of Bradicardia?",
    "content": null,
    "bestanswer": "Greetings:\nThis answer is in response to your question posted on yahoo concerning a possible link between bradycardia and ED.\nThere are many causes of ED. Bradycardia in and of itself is not a cause of ED, however, if the bradycardia is coming from say for example a blood pressure medication like a beta blocker, then you can experience ED. This is a side effect of the drug. If the heart rate is very, very low where there is inadequate blood flow to the penis and everywhere else in the body including the brain, then it may cause ED (you would be very ill and probably in the hospital in this instance).\nOften, bradycardia is associated with heart diseases. Cardiac disease is definately a potential cause of ED.\nPsychological, social, stress, money problems, are often causes of ED.  Others like diabetes, high blood pressure and long standing high cholesterol  are the BIG THREE.\nThe drugs out now, ie. viagra, levitra, cialis can and do work on most causes of ED but results are variable from person to person.\nThey dont cause you to instantly have an erection. Arousal comes from stimulation of the brain first by sexual thoughts then to the penis. So these drugs work only if your brain is aroused first.\nThe only time I know of that these drugs do not work is when there is severe nerve damage to the nerves responsible for erection and ejaculation.\nI hope this helped answer your question.\nRegards,\nWarren Shaffer, M.D.",

      "we we we!!!",
      "no",
      "It depends on the cause and the extent. If your heart is beating very slowly because of drug interactions for example, that might be a cause. You should ask your doctor if there is a correlation in your case.",
      "Even if your high blood pressure (or hypertension) has caused erectile dysfunction (ED), you have every reason to be optimistic about the future and a healthy sex life. It is a common problem associated with high blood pressure but there are many proven treatments you can try.\n\nA doctor's first choice for treating erection problems is usually one of the pills called PDE5 inhibitors. First there was Viagra. Now there's also Levitra and Cialis. All three drugs work in similar ways. They don't increase sexual desire. They make it physically possible to get an erection when you are aroused."

Starchy foods provide us with energy and fibre and because they are bulky foods, they also tend to be filling.\n\nStarchy food should be eaten with every meal and should form the main part of the meal. This means it is better to have a larger helping of rice, pasta or potatoes with a meal and a smaller serving of protein foods. Wholegrain varieties of starchy food are a good choice because of their fibre content and higher levels of vitamins and minerals.\n\nTry to avoid sugar or honey coated varieties when choosing breakfast cereals.\n\nFruit and vegetables  \nThis group includes : \n\n Fresh fruit and vegetables (including salad vegetables) \n Frozen and tinned fruit and vegetables \n Dried fruit such as sultanas and raisins \n Fruit juices \n\nPotatoes do not count as a vegetable food. They are classed as a starchy food.\nHealthy eating advice\n\nYou should aim to eat five portions each day. One portion is equivalent to one of the following : \n\n one slice of melon or pineapple \n one piece of \"large fruit, e.g. an apple, orange or banana \n two pieces of \u201cmedium\u201d fruit, e.g. satsumas, plums \n a small tea cup of \u201csmall\u201d fruit, e.g. cherries, grapes \n two tablespoons of boiled vegetables \n one small cereal bowl of salad \n one tablespoon of dried fruit \n two tablespoons of baked beans \n 150mls of pure fruit juice \nand more......",

    "content": null,
    "bestanswer": "is it latent or active\n\nHow does a doctor diagnose tuberculosis? \n\nTB can be diagnosed in several different ways, including chest X-rays, analysis of sputum, and skin tests. Sometimes, the chest x-rays can reveal evidence of active tuberculosis pneumonia. Other times, the x-rays may show scarring (fibrosis) or hardening (calcification) in the lungs, suggesting that the TB is contained and inactive. Examination of the sputum on a slide (smear) under the microscope can show the presence of the tuberculosis bacteria. A sample of the sputum can also be grown (cultured) in special incubators so that the tuberculosis bacteria can subsequently be identified.\n\nSeveral types of skin tests are used to screen for TB. These so-called tuberculin skin tests include the Mantoux test, the Tine test, and the PPD (purified protein derivative) test. In each of these tests, a small amount of purified extract from dead tuberculosis bacteria is injected under the skin. If a person is not infected with TB, then no reaction will occur at the site of the injection (a negative skin test). If a person is infected with tuberculosis, however, a raised and reddened area will occur around the site of the test injection. This reaction, a positive skin test, occurs about 48 to 72 hours after the injection.\n\nIf the infection with tuberculosis has occurred recently, however, the skin test can be falsely negative. The reason for a false negative test with a recent infection is that it usually takes 2 to 10 weeks after the time of infection with tuberculosis before the skin test becomes positive. The skin test can also be falsely negative if a person's immune system is weakened or deficient due to another illness such as AIDS or cancer, or while taking medications that can suppress the immune response, such as cortisone or anti-cancer drugs.\n\nRemember, however, that the TB skin test cannot determine whether the disease is active or not. This determination requires the chest x-rays and/or sputum analysis (smear and culture) in the laboratory. The organism can take up to six weeks to grow in culture in the microbiology lab. A special test to diagnose TB is now available. This special test detects the genetic material of the bacteria, called the PCR (polymerase chain reaction). This test is extremely sensitive (it detects minute amounts of the bacteria) and specific (it detects only the TB bacteria). One can usually get results from the PCR test within a few days.\n\nhttp://www.medicinenet.com/tuberculosis/page3.htm",

    "content": null,
    "bestanswer": "(m)\n\nThe tonsils are two clumps of tissue, on either side of the throat, embedded in a pocket at the side of the palate (roof of the mouth).  The lower edge of each tonsil is beside the tongue...way in the back of the throat.  The adenoids are a single clump of tissue in the back of the nose (nasopharynx).  They are located (in the adult) on the back wall of the throat (pharynx)...about one inch above the uvula (the little teardrop shaped piece of tissue that hangs down in the middle of the soft palate).  \n\nThe tonsils and the adenoids are mostly composed of lymphoid tissue, which is found thoughout the gastointestinal tract and on the base of the tongue.  Lymphoid tissue is composed of lymphocytes...which are mostly involved in antibody production.  Since we generally consider antibody production to be a good thing, many studies have been performed to try to clarify the importance of the tonsils.   There seems to be no adverse effect on the immune status or health of patients who have had them removed.  Any noticable effect has generally been positive. It appears that the tonsils and adenoids were not \"designed\" to effectively handle the multitude of viral infections that occur in children in an urban population.  Rather, the immune system, including the tonsils and adenoids, developed during a era where the child was rarely exposed to a large number of other people and the germs they carried.  It may also be that these organs are relatively more important in dealing with certain types of infections, such as worms or other parasites, that are relatively uncommon in today's society.  It is clear that in many cases, the tonsils and/or the adenoids become \"dysfunctional\" and are more of a liability than an asset.\n\nHow are tonsils removed?   There are many techniques used for tonsillectomy.  General anesthesia is usually employed; but it is possible to perform tonsillectomy with sedation and local anesthesia.  In the United States, some degree of electrocautery assisted dissection is most commonly employed, because of the ability to rapidly stop bleeding.  Some surgeons use very little cautery...with more bleeding, but with less burned tissue.   Use of lasers has been studied and considered by most surgeons.  We feel that laser use is primarily a marketing gimmack at this point, since it offers no apparent advantage over certain cautery techniques, and has some very real hazards and extra costs.",

I shall turn a dark place before them into light, and rugged terrain into level land. These are the things that I will do for them, and I will not leave them.\u201d\n\n(Isaiah 29:18) And in that day the deaf ones will certainly hear the words of the book, and out of the gloom and out of the darkness even the eyes of the blind ones will see.\n\n(Luke 4:18) \u201cJehovah\u2019s spirit is upon me, because he anointed me to declare good news to the poor, he sent me forth to preach a release to the captives and a recovery of sight to the blind, to send the crushed ones away with a release,",

    "content": "i want an article about what smoking cigarettes can do to your body . i also want it in a 8 grade form",
    "bestanswer": "The mixture of nicotine and carbon monoxide in each cigarette you smoke temporarily increases your heart rate and blood pressure, straining your heart and blood vessels. \n\nThis can cause heart attacks and stroke. It slows your blood flow, cutting off oxygen to your feet and hands. Some smokers end up having their limbs \namputated.\n\nTar coats your lungs like soot in a chimney and causes cancer. A 20-a-day smoker breathes in up to a full cup (210 g) of tar in a year.\n\nChanging to low-tar cigarettes does not help because smokers usually take deeper puffs and hold the smoke in for longer, dragging the tar deeper into their lungs.\n\nCarbon monoxide robs your muscles, brain and body tissue of oxygen, making your whole body and especially your heart  work harder. Over time, your airways swell up and let less air into your lungs.\n\nSmoking causes disease and is a slow way to die. The strain put on your body by smoking often causes years of suffering. Emphysema is an illness that slowly rots your lungs. People with emphysema often get bronchitis again and again, and suffer lung and heart failure.\n\nLung cancer from smoking  is caused by the tar in tobacco smoke. Men who smoke are ten times more likely to die from lung cancer than non-smokers.\n\nSmoking causes around one in five deaths from heart disease.",

And although it commonly occurs when bacteria enter the skin through cuts or insect bites, it can also develop in skin that's perfectly healthy.\n\nImpetigo starts as a red sore that quickly ruptures, oozes for a few days and then forms a yellowish-brown crust that looks like honey or brown sugar. The disease is highly contagious, and scratching or touching the sores is likely to spread the infection to other parts of the body as well as to other people.\n\nImpetigo is seldom serious, and minor infections may clear on their own in two to three weeks. But because impetigo can sometimes lead to complications, your child's doctor may choose to treat it with an antibiotic ointment or oral antibiotics. Your child can usually return to school or a child-care setting as soon as he or she isn't contagious \u2014 often within 24 hours of starting antibiotic therapy.",

    "subject": "I cannot sleep at night. What can I do to help get at least 6 hrs sleep. I am always tired?",
    "content": "I think im an insomiac.",
    "bestanswer": "for the sake of better sleep: \n\n1. Keep regular hours. The best way to ensure perfect nights is to stick to a regular schedule. If you sleep late one morning and rise before dawn the next, you can come down with a home-bound version of jet lag. To keep your biological clock in sync, get up at the same time, regardless of how much or how little you've slept. \nTry to stick close to your usual sleep schedule on weekends and holidays as well as workdays. If you stay up late on Friday and Saturday nights and sleep-in the following mornings you may give yourself a case of \"Sunday-night insomnia\": You get to bed early to be bright eyed on Monday morning and try to sleep, but you can't. The harder you try, the more wakeful you feel. When travel or work throws of your routine, try to maintain some semblance of regularity. Eat your meals at the same times you normally do. Try to get some sleep during your usual bedtime hours. And return to your normal schedule as soon as you can. \n\n2. Exercise regularly. Exercise enhances sleep by burning off the tensions that accumulate during the day, allowing both the body and mind to unwind. While the fit seem to sleep better and deeper than the flabby, you don't have to push to utter exhaustion. A 20 to 30 minute walk, jog, swim or bicycle ride at least three days a week--the minimum for cardiovascular benefits--should be your goal. \nBut don't wait too late in the day to exercise. In the evening, you should be concentrating on winding down rather than working up a sweat. And don't expect early-morning exercise to have any impact on the tensions that build up during the day. The ideal exercise time is late afternoon or early evening, when your workout can help you shift gears from daytime pressures to evening pleasures. \n3. Cut down on stimulants. North Americans drink 400 million cups of coffee a day and get extra doses in tea, cola drinks (including diet colas) and chocolate. Some people seem sensitive to even small amounts; others build up a tolerance. \nIf you're a coffee lover, have your last cup of the day no later than six to eight hours before your bedtime. Its stimulating effects will peak for two to four hours later, although they'll linger for several hours more. Late-evening caffeine can make it harder for you to fall asleep, diminish deep sleep and increase nighttime awakening. \n\nCaffeine isn't the only dietary sleep-robber. Tyrosine, a substance found in chocolate, Chianti and cheddar cheese can trigger heart palpitations in the night. Diet pills contain stimulants that can keep you awake. Other drugstore drug interactions can also disrupt you nights. If you're taking any prescription or over-the-counter drugs, ask your doctor whether they may affect your sleep. \n\n4. Sleep on a good bed. A good night's sleep starts from the bottom up. You're less likely to get deep, solid, restful sleep on a bed that's too small, too soft, too hard or just plain too old. Unfortunately, we tend to get used to our old mattresses and box springs--just like a broken-down pair of old running shoes--and may not realize they've gradually been losing their comfort and support. If your bed is older than eight to ten years, use our on-line bed check to determine if it is ready for retirement. In selecting a new sleep set, follow Goldilocks' rule: Try a variety of mattresses and choose the one that feels just right for you. \n5. Don't smoke. Nicotine is an even stronger stimulant than caffeine. According to several studies, heavy smokers take longer to fall asleep, awaken more often and spend less time in REM and deep NREM sleep. Because nicotine withdrawal can start two to three hours after their last puff, some smokers wake in the night craving a cigarette. When smokers break their nicotine habit, their sleep improves dramatically. In one study, two-pack-a-day smokers who quit cut the time they lay awake in bed by almost half. \n6.",

    "content": "Hey, I've had Herpes since 1992 which I picked up in Hawaii on my way to Gulf War 1, It was a one night stand....and yes I used protection. \n\nAnyways, its 2006 and I have hidden my STD from friends and family, with exception of a handfull of dates from various STD dating sites. \n\nIts been tough all these years not being able to date and having to give freinds and family excuses for still being single...etc. Needless to say I  have never passed on the disease, as I would feel less then a man.\n\nThe depression just keeps adding on as I am now a good 80lbs overweight.  When you don't feel attractive inside....you tend to  not care about the outside....\n\nThis being said, I'm not feeling sorry for myself, whats done is done and I have to continue on....\n\nWhat would you do if you were in my shoes?",
    "bestanswer": "Hi there. I have had Herpes since 1990. Let me tell you I had a tough time  at first. I gained 70lbs, I felt ugly (which I'm not) I never thought that I would settle down.\n\n Well, I just married last year. My husband doesn't have herpes and he was very open about the whole idea of me having it.  And I happen to be his very first girlfriend, so he loved me enough for me. \n\nTry not to look for ladies with herpes just  because you have it. You might be missing out on someone very open and wonderful.\n\nI too, like you have way to much knowledge about herpes, but I see that it still didn't stop others from sending you more. \n\nStart working out and making yourself feel better and the Ladies will come. I will pray for you.",

And thank you so much for being responsible about it.  Its people like you that could make the STD percentage rate drop dramatically.  To bad a bunch of morons get infected.  Dont be so hard on yourself if its finding a woman to except your problem that's bumming you I think you will do better if you worked on your self esteem.  I'm 21 not infected with anything dont have a problem getting guys and I would most definitely date a guy who had this problem if he was like able in every other aspect.\n\n\nOh and for people who think it is \"nasty\" that is like saying your nasty if you get the flu.  Nobody asks for it.  I went to school with a very popular nice girl who stayed a virgin until 22 and the first guy she had sex with gave her herpes.",

Once infected, the virus stays in the body for the rest of the individual's life\nResearch suggests that the virus can be transmitted even when there are no symptoms present, so that a sexual partner without obvious genital herpes sores may still transmit the illness.

I know it is hard, but when you date you have to tell her if you think you are getting serious. She will either love you enough to stay or will leave.

    "bestanswer": "Puberty\nInformation for Boys and Girls\nPublic Education Brochure \n \nAs part of growing up, you will go through puberty. Puberty is the time in your life when your body changes from that of a child to that of an adult. These changes are caused by chemicals in the body called hormones. Because there are so many changes that happen during puberty, you may feel like your body is out of control. In time, your hormones will balance out and your body will catch up.\nNot only does your body change, but your emotions change too. How you think and feel about yourself, your family and friends, and your whole world, may seem different. As you go through puberty, you will begin to make important decisions for yourself, take on more responsibilities, and become more independent.\nIf you are already going through some of these changes, you may be asking yourself, \"Am I normal?\" or \"Do other people my age feel the way I do?\" Don't worry. Lots of changes happen during puberty and, although it can be a confusing time of life, it can be exciting.\nThis brochure was written to help you understand and deal with the changes puberty brings. Part 1 is about the changes girls go through during puberty. Part 2 is about the changes boys go through during puberty. Part 3 contains information for both girls and boys about the emotional changes during puberty. After you read the whole brochure you will learn not only about the changes you are going through, but also about the changes that are happening to the opposite sex.\nPart 1: Information for Girls\nPuberty is the time in a girl's life when her body changes from that of a young girl to that of a woman. It is also the time when a girl becomes physically able to have babies. Although there is no \"right\" time for puberty to begin, it generally starts earlier for a girl than it does for a boy - usually between 9 and 13 years of age. This is why many girls are taller and may act more mature than boys for a few years until the boys catch up.\nHow will my body change?\nFollowing are some of the changes your body will go through during puberty:\nBreasts: In most girls, puberty starts with breast growth. When your breasts start to develop, you may notice small, tender lumps under one or both nipples that will get bigger over the next few years. When breasts first begin to develop, it is not unusual for one breast to be larger than the other. However, as they develop, they will most likely even out before they reach their final size and shape. As your breasts develop, you may need a bra. Some girls feel that wearing a bra for the first time is exciting - it is the first step toward becoming a woman! However, some girls feel embarrassed, especially if they are among the first of their friends to need a bra. If the people around you make a bigger deal of your first bra than you would like, try to remember that they do not mean to embarrass you, they are just proud of how much you have grown.\nHair: Soft hair will start to grow in the pubic area (the area between your legs). This hair will eventually become thick and very curly. You may also notice hair under your arms and on your legs. Many women shave this hair. There is no medical reason to shave, it is simply a personal choice. If you decide to shave, be sure to use a lot of soap and water and a clean razor made for women. It is a good idea to use your own personal razor or electric shaver and not to share one with your family or friends.\nBody shape: Hips get wider and your waist will get smaller. Your body will also begin to build up fat in the stomach, buttocks, and legs. This is normal and gives your body the curvier shape of a woman.\nBody size: Arms, legs, hands, and feet may grow faster than the rest of your body. Until the rest of your body catches up, you may feel a little clumsier than usual. \nSkin: Skin may get more oily and you may notice you sweat more. This is because your glands are growing too.

Is anyone out there aware of any new treatment or drugs that might help this.  He was only given 3 months if the chemo did not work and if it does he was given more than a year.

Even in the grimmest hours, we still hope that there is a chance.  The alternatives are not great yet we still hope.  Your dad sounds pretty sick and yet he is willing to undergo chemotherapy.  The chemotherapy even if it works will only make him sicker and feel more awful.  He could enroll in a clinical trial and consensually be a guinea pig.  So for the next 3-12 months, he will be going to doctors and seeking second opinions.  He may be sick and end up in the hospital a few times.  He may even seek alternative \"miracle\" herbs.  Why do people want to go thru that?  Why don't people seriously consider Hospice as a legitimate option?  Why do oncologist push there clinical protocols - are they benefitting society or do they just want to publish a paper that shows that their regiment will increase survival by 3 months?  Sometimes it is okay to give up hope.  \n\nI can honestly say that if I have stage 4 stomach cancer that my goals would be 1)put my affairs together 2)keep me comfortable 3)let me spend the time I have the way I want to spend it and not in a hospital, not getting chemotherpy, not in a doctor's office 3)let me die with dignity at home and not in a hospital with tubes.",

I would always have break thru bleeding a week before my regular period.  SO it would be like having it for almost 2 weeks.  So early this year i decided to try the depo shot.  I haven't had any problems other then it's a week before I go in for my next shot and I'm flowing like the mississippi.  Do you think I should try going back on the pill or stick with the shot?  If anyone else has had problems with break thru on the pill and have found a pill that works well let me know.",
    "bestanswer": "In my opinion, I would stay the heck away from depo! I've had friends that have taken the shot and refuse to ever go back on it becuase of the side effects. How long were you on the pill for? Its common to have breakthrough bleeding when you're on the pill untill it gets regulated into your body. I would suggest going back on them. Give it some time, all side effects of the pill disappear within 3-12 months. I'm not sure where you live but myself and a few other gals I know are on the pill \"Marvalon\" and none of us have ever experienced side effects becuase of them. The only thing is it may not be offered where you live.. I find the States have alot of brands of b/c pills that I don't believe they sell over here so I would assume it works the oppsite way too.\n\nHope this helped! Best of luck :)",

    "subject": "Is diabetes reversible?",
    "content": "Type 2",
    "bestanswer": "It depends. Mostly on a lot of stuff we only dimily understand. But yes, sometimes, sort of.\n\nIn the case of type 2, the situation is more or less as follows. \n\nThe characteristic problem in type 2 is that most o fhte body's cells have decided, more or less, to stop responding to insulin in its glucose uptake function control role. Why this should be is now somewhat understood (ie, we think we see the mechanisms inside the cell, but not much more), but we don't know why there is so much variation from one patient to another. Some type 2s have only a slightly elevated glucose levels. Some rather more and some are completely out of control. \n\nPart of the reason for the variation appears to be due to the amount of abdominal fat present (around the organs there). This fat, but not it seems thunder thighs, or double chins, or love handles, is very active. It produces a variety (that we've found so far) of signalling chemicals --  to everyone's surprise, and also seems to be characteristically inflammed (ie, the immunological reaction). Losing even a small amount of that fat seems to reduce the severity of the inflammation and often of type 2, especially in less severe patients. Not always of course. And exercise generally helps muscle cells absorb glucose with or without insulin. And reducing the amount of glucose that has to be handled is good too. \n\nSo, if you're a borderline type 2 diabetic, you might be able to go back to something like normal blood glucose control if you exercise, lose enough weight to reduce the amount of fat in and around your abdominal organs, and keep your food intake reasonable. Lots of carbohydrate (sugary soda included) will break down into glucose and be absorbed into the blood, fat in the diet will end up stored in various places around the body, including the abdomen, and so on. \n\nIf your situation is not very severe, and you diet and exercise proeprly, you might be able to get back to normal. But, the underlying condition remains. You may not be able to stay normal no matter what you do, and if you gain weight or stop exercising or stop eating right, it is likely to come back. \n\nWhy all of thsi works the way it does is quite obscure. It's clear there is a strong genetic component to type 2, but it's not enough, for not every one with the genetic background gets type 2. And people with no genetic history in their family do get type 2. Much research is under way attempting to make sense of this, but it's a hard problem.",

I have pretty much no pain when walking, and I am walking as I was before the fall now. I just would have thought the swelling would have gone away before now, it still looks like a small egg on the side of my ankle. Does anyone have any suggestions as to what to do?

    "content": "Im a 21/F and have been constipated for over 2 years now. I dont eat the best food but I eat a lot better than most people and I am always constipated. For the record I am about 140 lbs. I have gained over 20 lbs in 2 years since I moved out. I had really bad cramps so I went to the emergency room and I found out the cramps were being caused because I was extremely constipated so they gave me some powder to mix into water that I have to drink every morning for like 3 days. So I did that and it worked and I was ok for about a week and then my constipation came back. I am now eating better than I have been and am eating salads and vegetable soup and I drink about 2 bottles of water a day and I am staying away from cheese!.....but nothing has changed, im still really constipated!! Besides the emergency room I havent been to a doctor in almost 4 years now because I dont have insurance. Could I possibly have a condition that is causing the constipation? Could it be colon cancer?",
    "bestanswer": "Funny you're asking this, because I have the same problems as you (also 21/F). The way it sounds, you could have a condition called IBS. It's characterized by bloating, either constipation or diarrhea, lower abdominal cramps, and mucus along with a bowel movement. I have IBS, and I also am constipated most of the time. What really helps (and I swear by this) is taking fiber supplements like Metamucil. The best form of taking this is by mixing the powder into water. It helps your stool become soft and pass through quickly. I highly recommend this as a long-term solution to constipation. \nThere are some foods that help as well: anything containing fiber (especially oatmeal!), lots of water, and prunes (either dried or fresh, doesn't matter). Fatty food such as chocolate or cheese sometimes aggravates the problem.\nIt's good that you're drinking lots of water, but sometimes, it's just not enough to get rid of constipation. Try Metamucil, and you will see instant results if you take the recommended dosage.",

I did this and haven't had any trouble with constipation since, and it has been almost a year.  the brand i used was renew life. you can look it up and order it on the internet at www.renewlife.com\nafter you do the cleanse make sure you get enouigh water each day.  this will ensure you dont' get the problem again. good luck",

    "bestanswer": "I would say obesity and related diseases such as type 2 diabetes.One reason is the poor quality of food we are routinely subjected to.  With computers, and endless tv watching etc., we are becoming an increasingly sedentary culture.  There seems to be an increasing trend of overweight humans from tottlers all the way to senior citizens, one could argue that most people who are obese do not live to be that old- but there do not appear to be a shortage of obese people in virtually every age group.\nWell, education does not necesarily equate to behavioral changes does it?  How many times have we heard health care professionals tell us to eat lots of fruits and vegitables and to excercise regularly?  I can recite it in my sleep, but still have this weakness for cinnamon buns!  I believe, and recent research has validated that eatting trends need be established at a very early age- from totlers right on up.  Clinton has initiated a campaign to get the sugary soda and candy and related junk food machines out of the schools.  Continue to develop healthy and tasty alternatives to the endless junk we are continuously subjected to at the grocery stores.  So, address the issue both on suppling healthier alternatives and teaching people at a very young age to eat healthy and take care of our bodies.\nThe third part of your question about lowering rates of disease- I believe the incidence of Lukemia has been markedly decreased over the last 10-15 years.\nGood, thought provoking question- like to take this brain box out for a spin from time to time!",

      "To clear up what some of the other posts said, first of, a nursing diagnosis is different from a medical diagnosis.  Nurses can't diagnose diabetes, but they can diagnose certain things the go along with diabetes.  The correct nursing diagnoses are the two that had the r/t bits in them.\n\nAs far as diagnosising type 1 is conscerned, the person who says they are a doctor is correct, because type 1 is diagnosed when the insulin levels are low, though this always goes along with high blood sugar.\n\nHigh blood sugar is diagnostic of diabetes, but the insulin level tests are required to tell what type it is.",
      "nursing diagnosis?  not sure what you mean\n\ntype I dm (diabetes mellitus) best diagnosed by complete abscence of insulin in the body.  Should also test pre-insulin, c-peptide, and blood glucose to confirm.\n\nboth pre-insulin and c-peptide are zero in DMI, glucose is elevated.",
      "Interesting to hear that advise from 'a doc'. In the UK, DM is diagnosed by timed glucose measurements or a random blood glucose over 11. There's something called impaired glucose tolerance where your glucose levels are slightly above normal. Type 1 is identified from 2 clinically.\n\nNot sure why c-peptide is measured in the US. HbA1c is measured in the UK but this is to check on glucose control post diagnosis.",

    "content": "My chest hurts could it just be heartburn in the same place?",
    "bestanswer": "In an acronym, GERD (gastro-esophageal-reflux-disease). What does this mean? Basically it means what it says. There is a reflux of stomach contents upward from the gastro (stomach) area into the lower portion of the esophagus or food pipe if you will. By food pipe, I mean the tube that food travels along to get into the stomach. Normally, a sphincter, or valve, prevents this from happening. But, if this valve is not functioning properly, and or the contents are under a great deal of pressure, reflux occurs - the sphincter is bypassed, and the nasty acid environment of the stomach moves to the food pipe. The trouble is of course, the food pipe isn't meant to handle that kind of acidity, and a 'burning' pain results.\n\nYou feel the pain at about the position you would if you were having a heart attack (midchest). Since this is the case, health practioners treat heart burn as if it were a heart attack until this can be ruled out. \n\nIt lasts as long as it lasts. Now on this I'm not entirely sure; I would think it would be somewhat individual. First, we have to take into account the digestive process time, the individual's pain receptors - and how long after the fact they keep transmitting, neutralizing agents - like drinking fluids, and of course whether or not an ulcer has developed as a result of longstanding digestive problems. If an ulcer is present, I would imagine pain could go on and on and on... \n\nIf you're having chest pain, you should see your doctor - putting this off for any reason puts your health at risk. If you have a long standing, diagnosed problem with GERD, then taking a prescribed antacid might not be a bad idea, if the pain is the same as you've been having and non-radiating. If the pain is different in anyway though, seeing the doctor right away again becomes advisable - especially if the antacids don't do the trick.",

    "content": "My aunty is suffering from breast cancer and she had her surgery twice + chemotherapy. Recently, again third time it has been detected that cells has been widespread into brain now. Could you advise or help as how to save her life in this stituation? Her life is on on high risk now and doctors are going to adopt radio-treatment.",
    "bestanswer": "I have always believed that the mainstream medical industry is not interested in finding a cure for cancer because it makes too much profit with its present barbarous methods.\nEventually, I came across a detailed report which agreed with my findings, and I have included it in my web page at\n\nhttp://dgwa1.fortunecity.com/body/cancer.html\n\nBy reading this report, you will also convince yourself that it is best to ignore the mainstream cancer industry, and seek alternative cures. Also you should bear in mind that the medical industry will do anything to protect its profitable position, including disparaging alternative healers or even creating bogus court cases.\n\nI believe that cancer is a whole body thing, which in 80 percent of cases manifests itself by producing symptoms in the weaker parts of the body, and therefore appearing localised. It is this treatment of symptoms instead of cause which creates the profitable, yet non-successful approach of mainstream medicine.\n\nSome cures are listed on the web page too.\n\nIt is therefore obvious that a holistic approach is required, based on cleansing, diet, exercise and debugging.\n\nCLEANSING\nThe best way of cleansing is to fast.\n\nhttp://www.phifoundation.org/menses.html\nhttp://www.healthy.net/scr/article.asp?ID=1996\n\nbut if a patient is too weak for that, or does not fancy the idea, then alternative cleanses are available.\n\n\nColon Cleanse\nhttp://www.soundfeelings.com/free/colon_cleansing.htm#recipe\nBowel cleanse\nhttp://www.curezone.com/schulze/herbal_colon_cleanse_1_2.asp\nkidney cleanse\nhttp://www.curezone.com/cleanse/kidney/default.asp\nhttp://www.ehow.com/how_12678_kidney-cleansing-fast.html\nhttp://www.falconblanco.com/health/cleansing/kidney.html\nhttp://www.healingdaily.com/colon-kidney-detoxification.htm\nhttp://www.healthfree.com/cleansing_programs_kidney.html\nLiver cleanse\nhttp://www.drclark.net/en/drclark_protocol/illnesses/liver_cleanse.php\nGallbladder cleanse\nhttp://www.curezone.com/cleanse/liver/default.asp\nhttp://www.curezone.com/cleanse/liver/huldas_recipe.asp\nPancreas cleanse\nhttp://curezone.com/dis/1.asp?C0=261\n\nDIET,\nThe best diet is vegetarian, avoiding all processed, frozen or micro-waved foods and drinks, and based on fresh fruit, fresh vegetables - preferably organic, nuts and seeds. Drinks should be clean water or freshly squeezed orange juice.\n\nMany researchers promote the benefits of vitamin B17 as a healer. this can be found in the following foods:\nApple seeds, alfalfa sprouts, apricot kernels, bamboo shoots, barley, beet tops, bitter almond, blackberries, boysenberries, brewer\u2019s yeast, brown rice, buckwheat, cashews, cherry kernels, cranberries, currants, fava beans, flax seeds, garbanzo beans, gooseberries, huckleberries, lentils, lima beans, linseed meat, loganberries, macadamia nuts, millet, millet seed, peach kernels, pecans, plum kernels, quince, raspberries, sorghum cane syrup, spinach, sprouts (alfalfa, lentil, mung bean, buckwheat, garbanzo), strawberries, walnuts, watercress, yams.\n\nA commercial preparation of B17 is available called Laetrile.\n\nEXERCISE\nExercise should be sufficient to create a sweat, but not sufficient to make you gasp for breath or feel over-tired. About one hours exercise every day is best.\n\nDEBUGGING\nThere are various theories about how bugs create cancer.\n\nHulda Clark suggests that parasites are the cause, and that they can be disposed of by using a zapper.\n\nZappers are available from\n\nSuper Zapper DeLuxe\nhttp://www.drclark.net      Clark Zapper with amazing features get a free CD ROM\n\nhttp://www.paradevices.com/zapper_works.html\n\nTerminator Crystal Orgone Zapper Blood Purification Parasite Solution\nElectrical stimulation devices for blood purification, parasites, relaxation, and addictions.\nhttp://www.elixa.com/estim/zap.htm\n\nHigh frequency parasite zapper.

    "content": "everything you can tell me about birthmark! sister's son got a birthmark that almost cover his whole tummy, my sister is afraid that it may be dangerous, is there a way to check if a birthmark is cancerous or not?",
    "bestanswer": "Birthmarks are colored marks on the skin that are present at birth or develop shortly after birth. They can be many different sizes, shapes, and colors, including brown, tan, black, blue, pink, white, red, or purple. Some birthmarks appear on the surface of the skin; some are raised above the surface of the skin; and some are located under the skin. \nIt is not clear why some children have birthmarks and others do not. Some birthmarks appear because a child has extra color (pigment) in his or her skin. Other birthmarks appear because a child's blood vessels did not develop normally or are grouped together too closely. Many folktales and myths exist about the causes of birthmarks, but none has been proven to explain the true causes of birthmarks.\nSalmon patches (also called stork bites, angel kisses, and macular stains). Salmon patches are thin, flat, light pink or red birthmarks. They occur most frequently on the back of the neck, the upper eyelids, upper lip, or between the eyebrows.\nCongenital moles (nevi). Congenital moles can appear anywhere on the body. They vary in size and shape, and are generally brown in color.\nCaf\u00e9-au-lait spots. Caf\u00e9-au-lait spots are smooth, generally oval birthmarks. They range in color from light brown to chocolate brown and are usually found on the torso, buttocks, and legs.\nMongolian spots. Mongolian spots are smooth, brown or blue-gray birthmarks. They usually are irregular in shape and are commonly found across the lower back and buttocks.\nHemangiomas. Hemangiomas are raised, blue, red, or purple birthmarks formed by a clump of immature blood vessels. They can be many sizes and shapes and are found both on the surface of the skin and deeper in the body.\nPort-wine stains. Port-wine stains are birthmarks that are pink-red at birth and then become a darker red-purple color. Port-wine stains are formed by blood vessels that did not develop properly. They can be small or they can cover a large area of the body.\nMost birthmarks are harmless and need no treatment. They often fade or disappear as a child grows older.\n\nA birthmark that causes problems with sight, breathing, hearing, speech or movement may need treatment. Birthmarks that are found on internal organs always need treatment and may be associated with more serious problems. Treatment is most common for hemangiomas and port-wine stains and can include corticosteroids, laser therapy, and surgery. \n\nSometimes the appearance of a large birthmark can make a child or the parents of a child feel shy or self-conscious. In some cases, makeup or hairstyles can hide birthmarks. Counseling and/or support groups may also help with any emotional issues caused by a birthmark.\nMore than 90% of birthmarks are diagnosed by a careful medical history and physical exam.1 Some birthmarks stay the same as a child grows older, while some birthmarks fade or disappear. Others grow quickly over a short period of time. Although most are harmless, all birthmarks or any changes in a birthmark need to be checked by a health professional.",

    "subject": "what is anemia?",
    "content": "tellme anemic conditions breifly",
    "bestanswer": "Anemia or anaemia (see spelling differences), which literally means \"without blood,\" is a deficiency of red blood cells and/or hemoglobin. This results in a reduced ability of blood to transfer oxygen to the tissues, and this causes hypoxia; since all human cells depend on oxygen for survival, varying degrees of anemia can have a wide range of clinical consequences. Hemoglobin (the oxygen-carrying protein in the red blood cells) has to be present to ensure adequate oxygenation of all body tissues and organs.\n\nThe three main classes of anemia include excessive blood loss (acutely such as a hemorrhage or chronically through low-volume loss), excessive red blood cell destruction (hemolysis) or deficient red blood cell production. In menstruating women, dietary iron deficiency is a common cause of deficient red blood cell production.\n\nAnemia is the most common disorder of the blood. There are several kinds of anemia, produced by a variety of underlying causes. Anemia can be classified in a variety of ways, based on the morphology of RBCs, underlying etiologic mechanisms, discernible clinical spectra, to mention a few.\n\nDifferent clinicians approach anemia in different ways; two major approaches of classifying anemias include the \"kinetic\" approach which involves evaluating production, destruction and loss, and the \"morphologic\" approach which groups anemia by red blood cell size. (Schier) The morphologic approach uses a quickly available and cheap lab test as its starting point (the MCV--see below). On the other hand, focusing early on the question of production (e.g., via the reticulocyte count) may allow the clinician to more rapidly expose cases where multiple causes of anemia may coexist. Regardless of one's philosophy about the classification of anemia, however, methodical clinical evaluation should yield equally good results.",
    "nbestanswers": [
      "Anemia is defined as reduction in the aomount of hemoglobin in the red blood cells.",
      "My wife is anemic,she's always tired and cold.She went to the doctor and he put her on some high iron pills.",
      "Anemia is the condition of having less than the normal number of red blood cells or less than the normal quantity of hemoglobin in the blood. The oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood is, therefore, decreased. Persons with anemia may feel tired and fatigue easily, appear pale, develop palpitations and become unusually short of breath. Children with chronic anemia are prone to infections and learning problems.",
      "If you have anemia, people may say you have tired blood. That's because anemia \u2014 a condition in which there aren't enough healthy red blood cells to carry adequate oxygen to your tissues \u2014 can make you feel tired.\n\nAnemia is a common blood disorder, affecting an estimated 3.4 million Americans. Women and people with chronic diseases are at increased risk of the condition.",
      "Anemia is g Greek word for \u201cbloodlessness\u201d. A blood condition involving an abnormal reduction in the number of red blood cells or in their hemoglobin content. These cells are the means by which oxygen is carried to the various parts of the body. People who are anemic develop symptoms caused by the inadequate delivery of oxygen to their body tissues. There are three primary causes of anemia: (1) reduced production of red blood cells, which may result from deficiency in nutrients or hormones, or from disease or other conditions; (2) excessive destruction of red blood cells, often a hereditary problem; and (3) excessive blood loss.\n\nThe most common type of anemia is iron-deficiency anemia, which occurs when the body's need for iron increases, as during certain periods of childhood and in pregnancy, or when there is insufficient iron in the diet. Pernicious anemia, a chronic ailment that mostly affects people over 40, is a result of vitamin B 12 deficiency, often caused by decreased B12 absorption rather than a deficient diet. The most common symptoms of anemia are pallor, shortness of breath, low vitality, dizziness, and digestive disorders. Sickle-cell anemia is the result of a hereditary defect in the synthesis of hemoglobin."

I took a shower and some Benadryl, and felt better.  This morning it was no longer noticeable and wasn't itchy, so I went to school.  However, after a fire drill (in which we went outside on a hill near the school, nowhere near the softball field) I noticed the rash again, now also on my hands.  I called my mom to come pick me up, and I am now sitting in her office at work, feeling fine after more Benadryl.  I am, however, still wondering what is happening to me.  Am I allergic to the weed killer, or a bug bite I got or something?  Or is it more serious?  If you have ever experienced or heard of this, please answer.  Thanks!",

    "content": "My mother is very depressed. She has been diagnosed with oral herpes (HSV1) and has been married to my father for 40 years. I think and she thinks that he is VERY FAITHFUL, but is there a possiblity that he may have kissed another woman and given this to her? They also went to a restaurant about three weeks ago and she drank directly from a bar glass (without a straw). Could this also be a way of getting this disease? The doctors are being very vague about how she got this. They asked her \"Who have you kissed?\", but if my father does not show any signs of it, could he have still given this to her? How long can the virus be dormant in the body? Also, can HSV1 become HSV2.......can the virus spread from her mouth to her genitals when it is an open sore? Any medical advice would be appreciated. The doctor also said if she performed oral sex with a man (which she didn't other than my father) that she could of also gotten this.  \n\nThank you so much!",
    "bestanswer": "Cold sores are caused by Herpes simplex type I. When your incfected, the virus \"hides\" in the nervous system between outbreaks. \nHSV1 is extremely prevalent (very easy to pass on, quite innocently, just by an injudicious kiss to a baby). Most everybody (up to 90% of the population) has antibodies against HSV1 by the time they're 50.\nNow about transmission: It mostly happens when you have a blister/blisters going, through direct skin-to-skin contact, but indirect transmission thorugh secondary contact through a glass, cup etc. is possible. Unfortunately, the virus can sometimes spread , when no signs or symptoms are present. This is called \"Asymptomatic Transmission.\" Often people don't know they are infected, these people may have symptoms so mild they don't notice them at all or else don't recognize them as herpes. They can also spread it. \nConsidering how common HSV1 is, your mum might have picked it up kissing a  baby somewhere, kissing a grandchild or a friend. To automatically assume there is cheating involved is not right. I was infected as a small child, by one of my parents, quite unknowingly. Your father might have a extremely mild infection, that flares up once every 10 years. There are a lot of explanations for your mums infection other than cheating. Please tell your mum that. \nAs far getting genital herpes is concerned, while HSV1 does NOT turn into HSV2, it can start genital herpes if the virus from a cold sore gets in touch with the genitals.\n\nFinally, another word - contrary to what a lot of people say, it is not a horrible disease like siphylis or whatnot. I have had it since I can remember and it never caused any problems. IT WILL NOT DEBILITATE HER OR MAKE HER LIFE HARD. \nI wish you all the best and please, try to calm your mum down.",

Likewise, it's possible that your mother has had it for longer than she realizes.  \n\nHerpes lesions in the mouth can spread to the genitals.  The way herpes spreads is by direct contact with the lesions.  I wouldn't suspect the bar glass as a possible source.",
