Sore tooth?,"I was eating some ice cream last night and one of my teeth started to hurt. It wasn't a really bad pain, it was more of a dull ache, and it lasted for a couple of hours. Does that mean I have a cavity? Or is the tooth just a bit sensitive?","The extent of sensitivity to cold can be determined by the strength of the enamel of a tooth. You may be sensitive to cold alone, but you may have a cavity. Your best bet is to see your dentist of course, as he or she will be the only one to tell you if you have a cavity. If you merely suffer from sensitivity, then you may want to try a toothpaste specifically designed to deal with this. My dentist changed my toothpaste to Sensodyne, because me teeth are soft and very sensitive. It does help. As I always say however, home remedies are great only if you aren't merely treating the symptoms of a larger problem.",The extent of sensitivity to cold can be determined by the strength of the enamel of a tooth.,Dental,Health,Dental,,,,information
My M.D. asked me for a Thyroid check up. He claims Lithium is harmful for the Thyroid Glad. Any M.D. Answer ?,"I will greatly appreciate other M.D.'s opinion whether this is so.
Got to take Lithium for the rest of my life and I've been having uncontrolled jerks while asleep and my Doctor is afraid that Lithium may be causing those sudden changes in my breathing rithm and uncontroled muscle movements. I only take much less than prescribed (just 150 milligrams a day )
When I don't take it I get depressed and can not eat nor sleep. Please HELP !!!","It is true that lithium can affect the thyroid gland (potentially making it underactive); and it can also affect your kidneys - this is why anyone on lithium should have periodic blood tests for thyroid and renal function, regardless of any symptoms. If your thyroid gland DOES become underactive, it is usually a simple matter to supplement with levothyroxine daily; and is therefore not such a big deal.
Generally the benefits of lithium in people with bipolar disorder or difficult to treat depression are considered to outweigh these risks; and this is why many millions of people are (safely) on lithium. This is especially true if you take a lower-than-average dose (as you do); because the chances of potential harmful side-effects ARE lowered with lower serum lithium levels.
The 'jerks' you mention dont sound related to your thyroid OR your lithium levels (which usually causes tremor if too high); but there is no harm in checking up on these.

First, 'poop' is brown because it is a mixture of green and rusty red.  The red comes from retired blood cells that are being excreted.  The greenish yellow is from bile, a substance present in your digestive system.  When there is significantly more bile than retired blood, the poo is more green (this is my many babies have green poo, their bodies aren't old enough to have retired enought red blood cells).  Bile 'overload' is somewhat rare, but is not a health issue.  If you experience abdominal cramping, dark/black stool or stool that is very thin (perhaps no thicker than a pencil) these can signs of very serious medical problems.  But for now, you're probably fine. Regards :)",The red comes from retired blood cells that are being excreted.,First Aid,Health,General Health Care,,,,information

Do caffine pills have dangerous side effects?,"I am in college and in order for me to stay awake I have been using caffine pills, energy drinks, and coffee. Is it safe and if not I can't stop because I am addicted to them!","And now, a reasonable answer:

Caffeine, has been studied VERY extensively and no significant long-term problems have been found.  It IS a drug and if you take to much you will be uncomfortable, maybe really uncomfortable. (it starts with the shakes and an upset stomach and gets worse from there. A severe anxiety attack is a possibility.)   A lethal dose for a human is about 150 cups of coffee is a short period of time (or the equivalent from pills, etc.)  That's hard to do...

It can exacerbate other conditions, in particular stuff like acid reflux or ulcers, but it has also been shown to apparently have some minor beneficial effects.    Still, the amount you're apparently taking is probably not healthy because its likely messing up your sleep, at least.

Caffeine addiction is real, but its fairly easy to get over.  You can go cold turkey and be miserable for up to two weeks (mostly lethargy and killer headaches), or you can ease yourself off of it.

Why does my wife have alzheimer's disease?,We've been married for 54 years.,"The cause of Alzheimer’s disease is not known, but several theories of causality have been advanced. These theories propose genetic, environmental, viral, immunological, biochemical, and other causes for the disease.
The specific features of Alzheimer’s disease vary from individual to individual, but the general course of the disease is fairly consistent in most cases. The symptoms of the disease tend to be more severe at night. The first stage of Alzheimer’s disease is usually forgetfulness, accompanied by some anxiety and mild depression. This usually develops into a more serious loss of memory, especially of recent events, moderate spatial and temporal disorientation, loss of ability to concentrate, aphasia, and increased anxiety. This set of symptoms is usually followed by profound spatial and temporal disorientation, delusions, hallucinations, incontinence, general physical decline, and death.

Is a vitamin deficiency linked to dark circles around the entire eye?,,"Most dark circles are caused by the appearance of veins beneath the thin skin under our eyes. As we age and our skin becomes more damaged due to sun exposure, the skin under our eyes becomes thinner and more wrinkled, which allows the veins in this fatty padded area under the eye to appear more prominent. These veins also become more swollen and obvious in people with allergies. Similarly, people with a history of eczema, hay fever or asthma often develop dark circles. They do, of course, become more apparent with a lack of sleep. In some people with dark skin, circles under the eye may actually be due to superficial pigmentation of the skin and not the underlying veins.

what is mitral valve prolapse and how does it make you feel?,,"The mitral valve is also known as the bicuspid valve and is found between the ventricles on the left side of the heart.

Mitral Valve Prolapse occurs when abnormalities in the mitral valve leaflets, chordae tendinae, or papillary muscles allow prolapse of the mitral valve leaflets backward into the LA during ventricular systole.

•	Abnormal mitral valve mechanism which results in billowing of one or both mitral leaflets into the left atrium towards the end of systole.
o  also known as Barlow’s syndrome, as well as “floppy”  
   or “billowing” mitral valve.
o  the leaflets become enlarged or thickened, and the 
   chordae tendinae become elongated. these changes allow 
   the valve leaflets to billow upward into the LA during 
   ventricular systole.
o  on auscultation, a mid-systolic click is heard

Mitral valve prolapse symptoms
•	Most patients: None
•	Chest pain
•	Palpitations
•	Easy fatigability
•	Arrhythmias
•	TIA
•	MR

whats  the  highest  blood sugar can  go to?,,"Each individual person will tolerate elevated blood glucose levels differently. Check your blood sugar regularly. 
In general, most sources will say that anything over 250 is reason for concern and would warrant a call to your doctor. Anything over 300, definitely deserves a call or even a trip to the ER if your hyperglycemia symptoms are severe enough. 
Most meters will give you a reading of ""HI"" or ""HIGH"" if your blood glucose level is elevated above 500. 
As always, anytime you feel you are having a high sugar reaction (hyperglycemia) or a low reaction (hypoglycemia), contact your doctor. Better safe than sorry...

This narrowing causes symptoms such as wheezing, shortness of breath, chest tightness, and coughing, which are the hallmarks of asthma. Between episodes, most patients feel fine.

The disorder is a chronic inflammatory condition in which the airways develop increased responsiveness to various stimuli, characterized by bronchial hyper-responsiveness, inflammation, increased mucus production, and intermittent airway obstruction. The symptoms of asthma, which can range from mild to life threatening, can usually be controlled with a combination of drugs and lifestyle changes.","Asthma is a disease of the human respiratory system in which the airways narrow, often in response to a trigger such as exposure to an allergen, cold air, exercise, or emotional stress.",Other - Diseases,Health,Diseases & Conditions,,,,cause

Women have been shown to have greater activity in the right side of their brains, proven by MRI scans (magnetic resonance indicator). It has been suggested that from primate times there was a greater inclination toward the right side in women due to evolotionary pressure to nurture and be compassionate, conversely males were more inclined to hunt and those males with greater sense of logic were more succesful.

Treatment depends on how sick he is.  Since he has diarrhea and vomiting, you need to get him off all solid foods and dairy products.  Put him on clear liquids, any thing he can hold down.  Start with a little pedialyte or 7UP with the bubbles stirred out of it.  The clear liquid diet will get his stomach and bowels quieted down.

How come guys have nipples?,My bro told me to ask this...yea thats it...my bro.  He hasn't been able to sleep for the last week because this is bugging him so much.,"Men and all male animals, have nipples.  This is a remnant of fetal development.  Human beings, male and female start developing the same way.  At an early time in fetal life, hormones are secreted and the fetus differentiates into male or female.  What is even more surprising is that basically, all humans start off as females, and then develop into males, as the hormones kick in during fetal life.  Men are bascally degenerates from the female form....a fact well known to embryologists.  That is, if the male hormone was not present at early development, then the fetus would become a female.  [let's see if your bro can sleep after this!]  Since we all start with the same 'template', some organs are vestigial...nipples being one of those organs.

And, do you know that if you take estrogens (the female hormone) you can actually grow functional breasts?.  Mind boggling, huh?!  Try to sleep now!!!

Should I be concerned about a scratch on my cornea (eye) caused by a kleenex?,"Last night, I got an eyelash stuck in my eye (the upper portion).  It hurt & I was desperate to get it out.  Like a fool, I used a kleenex dabbed in water to remove the eyelash.

Is this Depersonalization? Can someone help me please??,"Brief background: about 5 years ago experienced random episodes of a spacey depersonalized feeling that made me feel irritated and snappy, along with a severe problem with focusing or concentrating. I went to my doc and he prescribed me Effexor XR. My dose never went past 75mg. And as of the last 2.5 years I have got it down to dividing my 37.5 into thirds. I have wained myself down because I do not have depression at all, im very content, and my anxiety is not any more than average. I did not want to be on a med forever if i did not have a concrete reason as to why I should be on it.

Main issue: I know that effexor works on serotonin at the doses i am on... Straterra is known to work on norepinepherine, thus the reason it didnt curb the irritated spacey feeling i have... I am at my witts end here with this damn annoying feeling, its not debilitating just bad if it happens at work, and my girlfriend is not a fan and i dont blame her.

It can happen to anyone, even men as it is't just through using tampons. To help prevent getting TSS you can use natural tampons rarther than the branded ones. Alot of tampons contain toxicins and bleaches which effect your body in bad ways. Natural ones contain none of these substances. Theres also cup you can use instead of tampons & sanitary Towels. Other than that if you switch between tampons and towels during your period it will reduce the chances of getting it.

do staph infections cause migranes?,,"Migraines are the monster headaches that are simply vessels in your brain and brain area constricting. A staph infection will not cause this to happen. A staph infection COULD cause a sinus headache if the bacteria get into your sinus cavities. The best avenue would be for you to consult your doctor or medical practitioner. He/she will either prescribe antibiotic medication or a homeopathic script that will heal the infection and will heal the sinus area. If you want to help this for now until you see your doctor, try drinking the following: 1/4 teaspoon thyme in a cup of boiling water. Let the thyme steep for 10 minutes. Add 1 teaspoon of lemon juice and sweeten to taste, if you wish. The thyme tea will kill bacteria and will loosen sinus congestion and phlegm/mucus. You could also drink a hot bowl of soup with 1/2 teaspoon of garlic powder and a dash of cayenne pepper. This will also kill bacteria and loosen mucus.

A single dose of azithromycin or a week of doxycycline (twice daily) are the most commonly used treatments. HIV-positive persons with chlamydia should receive the same treatment as those who are HIV negative.

All sex partners should be evaluated, tested, and treated. Persons with chlamydia should abstain from sexual intercourse until they and their sex partners have completed treatment, otherwise re-infection is possible.

Women whose sex partners have not been appropriately treated are at high risk for re-infection. Having multiple infections increases a woman's risk of serious reproductive health complications, including infertility. Retesting should be considered for women, especially adolescents, three to four months after treatment.

The bladder is normally sterile, and if you for some reason get fecal matter in the area of your urethra, the e coli bacteria that's helpful in your intestine can wreak havoc on your urinary tract.  If you don't urinate often enough to flush bacteria out of the urethra, it's able to move up it to the bladder, where it starts to cause problems.  

No matter what you do, while you're on your meds and even afterwards, drink plenty of fluids (hence the recommended 8 glasses a day) so that you urinate regularly and often.  That will help to flush some of it out of your system and keep it from coming back.

does TSS symptoms occur after wearing a tampon several times?,,"""The problem does not seem to be the type of tampon used, but the length of time you keep it or something else in your body. Saying to yourself ""oh, they don't make that kind of tampon anymore, I'm perfectly safe"" is dead-nuts wrong. It wasn't the type of tampon, it was the amount of time women were wearing these superabsorbent tampons during their menstrual period that caused TSS.  So yes, change tampons regularly - don't wear one all night long - and use a low-absorbancy tampon or a pad on your light flow days.""

http://www.io.com/~wwwomen/menstruation/tss.html 

Rather than use a tampon, consider an alternative. There is a menstrual cup product called Instead. I use them almost exclusively. It can be worn safely for 12 hours. There is no string to pee on. You can swim, sleep, even have sex with it in. There is no danger of Toxic Shock Syndrome. The only draw back is that it is messy when you take it out. It is a cup that collects the menstrual blood, and there is not cotton-like material that absorbs it. I get around the messy factor by simply changing them during my morning shower. Check it out. I would never go back to pads or tampons.....

My cousin got her Hernia and colostomy surgery in India by a company called Forerunners Healthcare .The Price for Minimal Invasive and Laparoscopy surgery is very less in India. She paid 25% of the cost she was quoted in America.

Forerunners Healthcare is very famous in India. They arrange Hernia, Appendectomy, Thyroid and other laparoscopy surgery for foreigners in India.
I read a lot about them in the Newspapers and about their patient stories. They arrange financing for USA, Canadian, UK and other international patients who plan to have surgery abroad for low price, as the Hernia, Colostomy and other minimal invasive surgery is not covered by insurance. They also have photos pasted of their International patients. You can checkout their website. There are huge cost savings. As a doctor I personally believe that surgery can be easily handled in India, as the quality of healthcare available In India is simply best in the world. The surgeons are USA/UK trained and facilities are 5 star.

I want to know 100 % remedy for Hyperpigmentation on face?,"I tried various allopathy medicine ,but not satisfactory.Tell other remedies .","What is the cause of the hyperpigmentation?

I had hyperpigmentation due to acne (not severe, but every spot I got left behind a mark).

I used a product called Obagi NuDerm in combination with Retin A-Micro(to quicken the reproduction of skin cells, not to treat acne)over a period of three months to stellar results.

Obagi was a topical skin scare treatment that included washes, ointments and toner.  You can read about it here:

A girlfriend of mine seeking more quick and aggressive treatment (she is in the entertainment industry) tried an Obagi blue peel, and all of her marks were gone within weeks.

If you get a bad case of the flu, it can take 10 days to two weeks before you get back to normal activities and your energy level can be low for another two or three weeks. If you are just starting with a case of the flu, your doctor can prescribe something that will mitigate the flu symptoms, but you have to take it really early in the process or it won't work.

I feel fine most of the time but sometimes I do get really down and hurt myself/cry for hours. Should i be taking this - or am i setting myself up for lots of problems later?,"First of all, you shouldn't be asking for medical advice on here. You never know what you will get.

My own personal advice (check with your doctor). I have known a few people on Prozac and from what they have told me is that it doesn't change your personality or who they perceive themselves to be. What it does do is make it seem ""okay"" everything seems ""okay"". They tell me that it feels like they are walking in some kind of a fog and even looking down on themselves from time to time. However, with the right dosage these effects are kept to a minimum.

As for getting off the medicine, they will wean you off the medicine a little at a time because just stopping is dangerous.

Other things that seem to help. Check your diet for essential oils. I have been told that fish, like Tuna and Salmon, are good for fighting off depressive feelings if eaten on a regular basis. Also, exercise is a good stimulant (you can even get addicted to it), try something low impact at first. If you find that exercise is too mind numbing try martial arts (it exercises both your body and brain).

Wrinkled Fingers when swimming?,Why do your fingers (and toes) always wrinkled up when in the water for long periods?,"Your skin is too soft and there is a layer between your bones and skin whick absorbs water when you are in water. When the layer has absorbed enough water, it starts to send out the excess water to the skin. As the skin is too soft to contain water, it creates wrinkles in your skin and your wrinkles can hold water.

If you were in the water for a very long time, you would see cuts in your skin. This is because, when the wrinkles cannot hold the rest of the water, they cut portions of your skin and let the water flow out again.

I've tried to leave it alone.  When I do that, it doesn't disappear completely, and traces are left.  One of the recent ones I got, I went to my doctor who popped it.  I have one now, and tried to pop it.  But there wasn't really anything to pop.  I mean, nothing came out.  It seems just like a circular growth on my nose.

How do I prevent getting these things and what can I do to keep them away?  Thanks.",Warts are caused by the human papilloma virus.

Anyone know if Splenda/Equal causes tooth decay like regular sugar?,Since they're not real sugar do they cause cavities like regular sugar would?,"I'm a dentist.

There is no way someone's ""friend"" could do a ""science project"" studying whether or not sugar substitutes cause tooth decay....unless of course this ""friend"" had an entire lab with support staff and thousands of dollars worth of equipment.

Modern dental researchers use rats in carefully controlled environments.  They test for the effects of various materials on rats' teeth by sacrificing the rats and examining the teeth under electron microscopes...among other techniques.  It's not some high school science project like seeing which soil makes plants grow faster.

The answer to your question is ""no"".

These sweeteners, as far as I know, cannot be metabolized by the bacteria that cause tooth decay.

Tooth decay is caused by bacterial metabolism producing lactic acid as a waste product.  This lactic acid is what lowers the pH at the surface of your tooth and causes breakdown of the tooth structure.  If the bacteria residing on your teeth are not provided with food they can metabolize, then they cannot produce lactic acid and thus, cannot cause tooth decay.","If the bacteria residing on your teeth are not provided with food they can metabolize, then they cannot produce lactic acid and thus, cannot cause tooth decay.",Dental,Health,Dental,,,,information

You dont need to worry.  The answer above is right.  Rheumatic fever is caused by untreated strep throat infection.  Nowadays, its pretty uncommon thanks to simple antibiotic treatment.  The problem is definitely NOT hereditary.  In fact, it can't even be spread from person to person because by the time someone has rheumatic fever, the bacteria is long gone.

A VERY small percent of people with untreated strept throat develop rheumatic fever.  The bacteria itself doesn't infect the heart or its valves.  Rather, your body's immune response to fight off the bacteria accidentally damages your valves.  The valves most commonly affected are the mitral (and sometimes tricuspid) valves.","In fact, it can't even be spread from person to person because by the time someone has rheumatic fever, the bacteria is long gone.",Heart Diseases,Health,Diseases & Conditions,,,,information

"Is there a cure for costochondritis, a painful inflamation of the rib cartlidge?",Currently using Celebrex with little relief and I have little hope this iwll be anything but symptomatic benefit.,"I have had costochondritis for almost 11 years now. Although I don't believe there is a cure- I have learned some things over 11 years. Hopefully they will help you. First of all make sure you sleep enough. If you are in too much pain to sleep, either pain relievers or sleep aids may help you to get you over the hump. Second of all, anti-inflammatories did nothing for me ever.
Third- A series of stretching exercises that I have done religiously for 10 years almost every day in the shower helps the most. The stretching hurts when the inflammation is bad but after the pain subsides, I am more comfortable for the rest  of the day. I started with a whole host of stretching exercises but was able to cut it down over the years. 4th- the more exercise I get the better I feel.
5th- sitting down for long time periods seems to irritate it the most
6th- sleep with pillows between your knees and under your rib cage to ease comfort.
Like I said I hope this helps. I feel for you- it can be miserable but can also be managed. I don't get nearly as scared as I once did when it flares up. I just know what I have to do.",Although I don't believe there is a cure- I have learned some things over 11 years.,Pain & Pain Management,Health,General Health Care,,,,experience

How much of my (soon to be ex) wife's Infidelity & deciet was related to Major Depressive Disorder?,"Our marriage hit the rocks due to her & I being unequally yolked ( religiously) she believed in Christ, but she didn't show it with me.  She was diagnosed with an illness (Major Depressive Disorder) and she would hit me, say the meanest things and then tell me to leave.  I recently found the proof of her having an affair after at least a month of Suspiscion....She wrote in her own diary that I hit her and cheated on her & I can't figure out why would anyone lie to themselves through a devotional.  She is not on her meds anymore and I don't know how long she has not been taking the Zoloft.  I know I can't contribute her infidelity, forging and hot check  writing all to the disease, but I fear that the lover she moved in doesn't TRULY have a clue what he is in, & I also fear his violent  temper/ understanding may spark him to wail on her.  
I shouldn't care anymore, but I share a child with this woman and I wish I could know how much of all this Drama is due to her illness.","I had a husband who had bipolar disorder.  It was severe. He got arrested, shoplifted, embezzled from his jobs, was addicted to porn, chatted in porn chat rooms and eventually met up with the women he met on line, screamed, yelled, lied, broke things, slept for days, had obsessive compulsive symptoms, was addicted to Nyquil, alcohol, etc.

After doing an intervention and telling him he either needed to get some serious help or I would leave him, he told me no.  So I left him.  He has a new girlfriend now and she has two young children.  I worry for them, but you MUST understand that this is her life's journey and it is no longer your place to save her or HIM for that matter.  Let them be.  You live your life now. I have a child with mine too and the best I can do is love her all I can, help her understand her father's illness and let them have once a week visits, but never overnight.

All of those things you are describing about her behavior are illness related. It doesn't help that she didn't seem to have a solid spiritual grounding either.

Hematospermia
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
Jump to: navigation, search
Hematospermia, or the presence of blood in semen, is most often a benign and idiopathic symptom, but can sometimes result from medical problems such as a urethral stricture, infection of the prostate, or a congenital bleeding disorder, and can occur transiently after surgical procedures such as a prostate biopsy. It is present in less than 2% of urology referrals, although prevalence in the overall population is unknown.

Patients with hematospermia should be evaluated by a urologist to identify or rule out medical causes. Idiopathic hematospermia is sometimes treated with tetracycline and prostatic massage.",Hematospermia,Men's Health,Health,Men's Health,,,,cause

I am sorry to say this that there is no cure for this. Although there is no cure for sickle cell anemia, doctors can do a great deal to help patients, and treatment is constantly being improved.

All my problems are gone except for my left testicle and chunky sperm.","My first response is to ask your doctor, but it sounds like you've already done that... I don't know about this one. Have your completed the antibiotics? They don't work instantly so it may take a couple of weeks for an infection to clear up depending on which antibiotics you are taking. But for sure if you have completed the the antibiotics and this is not improved you should go back to your doctor. If he or she doesn't know what's wrong then ask for a referral to a urologist. That's a doctor who specializes in the urinary system. Urologists also deal a lot with prostate and other associated problems.",But for sure if you have completed the the antibiotics and this is not improved you should go back to your doctor.,Men's Health,Health,Men's Health,,,,suggestion
How does taking antidepressants effect work habits and drive?,I personally do very well at work and some talents and I'm wondering if they can ruin that.,"If you need an antidepressant, it should effect your work habits and drive in a positive way in general but it could make you feel like you have lost something if your inspiration for an art like performance, writing, painting is affected. If you are bipolar and an antidepressant is recommended as part of your treatment, your creativity may seem to be affected. The goal of giving a person a medication though, I would think, would be to enhance their quality of life over all. So I'd suggest finding a doctor who can work with you to find what works best for you including not medicating you if that is in your best interest.","The goal of giving a person a medication though, I would think, would be to enhance their quality of life over all.",Mental Health,Health,Mental Health,,,,information

Cause of Lower Right Quadrant pain?,"I have severe lower right quadrant pain and nausea. I'm also a little light headed and dizzy. Pain comes and goes.

What are possible causes?","The most common cause of RLQ pain is appendicitis. With your symptoms, it certainly sounds like it COULD be that.

Schizo Affective Disorder is where it is coupled up with a mood disorder and bipolar.  They also have symptoms of depression. These are often all grouped together.

A lot of the time they will also have grandiosity delusions that they are GOD or they know someone important in the world.  They try very hard to convince you of this.
